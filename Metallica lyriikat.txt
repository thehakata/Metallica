[James Hetfield]
[Lars Ulrich]

No life till leather
We are gonna kick some ass tonight
We got the metal madness
When our fans start screaming
It's right well alright
When we start to rock
We never want to stop again

You know our fans are insane
We are gonna blow this place away
with volume higher
Than anything today the only way
When we start to rock
We never want to stop again

Hit the lights
Hit the lights

With all our screaming
We are gonna rip right through your brain
We got the lethal power
It is causing you sweet pain Oh sweet pain
When we start to rock
We never want to stop again

Hit the lights
Hit the lights
Hit the lights


2. The Four Horsemen

[James Hetfield]
[Lars Ulrich]
[D. Mustaine]

By the last breath of the fourth winds blow
Better raise your ears
The sound of hooves knocks at your door
Lock up your wife and children now
It's time to wield the blade
For now you have got some company

The Horsemen are drawing nearer
On the leather steeds they ride
They have come to take your life
On through the dead of night
With the four Horsemen ride
or choose your fate and die

You have been dying since the day
You were born
You know it has all been planned
The quartet of deliverance rides
A sinner once a sinner twice
No need for confession now
Cause now you have got the fight of your life

The Horsemen are drawing nearer
On the leather steeds they ride
They have come to take your life
On through the dead of night
With the four Horsemen ride
or choose your fate and die

Time
has taken its toll on you
The lines that crack your face
Famine
Your body it has torn through
Withered in every place
Pestilence
For what you have had to endure
And what you have put others through
Death
Deliverance for you for sure
There is nothing you can do

So gather round young warriors now
and saddle up your steeds
Killing scores with demon swords
Now is the death of doers of wrong
Swing the judgment hammer down
Safely inside armor blood guts and sweat

The Horsemen are drawing nearer
On the leather steeds they ride
They have come to take your life
On through the dead of night
With the four Horsemen ride
or choose your fate and die


3. Motorbreath

[James Hetfield]

Living and dying laughing and crying
Once you have seen it you will never be the same
Life in the fast lane is just how it seems
Hard and it's heavy, it's dirty and mean

Motorbreath
It's how I live my life
I can't take it any other way
Motorbreath
The sign of living fast
It is going to take
Your breath away

Don't stop for nothing it's full speed or nothing
I am taking down you know whatever is in my way
Getting your kicks as you are shooting the line
Sending the shivers up and down your spine

Motorbreath
It's how I live my life
I can't take it any other way
Motorbreath
The sign of living fast
It is going to take
Your breath away

Those people who tell you not to take chances
They are all missing on what life is about
You only live once so take hold of the chance
Don't end up like others the same song and dance

Motorbreath
It's how I live my life
I can't take it any other way
Motorbreath
The sign of living fast
It is going to take
Your breath away

[James Hetfield]
[Lars Ulrich]
[D. Mustaine]

Down in the depths of my fiery home
The summons bell will chime
Tempting you and all the earth
to join our sinful kind
There is a job to be done and I'm the one
You people make me do it
Now it is time for your fate and I won't hesitate
to pull you down into this pit

So come on
Jump in the Fire
So come on
Jump in the Fire

With hell in my eyes and with death in my veins
The end is closing in
Feeding on the minds of man
and from their souls within
My disciples all shout to search out
And they always shall obey
Follow me now my child not the meek or the mild
But do just as I say

So come on
Jump in the Fire
So come on
Jump in the Fire

Jump by your will or be taken by force
I'll get you either way
Trying to keep the hellfire lit
I am stalking you as prey
Living your life as me I am you you see
There is part of me in everyone
So reach down grab my hand walk with me through the land
Come home where you belong

So come on
Jump in the Fire
So come on
Jump in the Fire

[James Hetfield]
[Lars Ulrich]

Late at night all systems go
You have come to see the show
We do our best You're the rest
You make it real you know
There is a feeling deep inside
That drives you fuckin' mad
A feeling of a hammerhead
You need it oh so bad

Adrenaline starts to flow
You're thrashing all around
Acting like a maniac
Whiplash

Bang your head against the stage
Like you never did before
Make it ring Make it bleed
Make it really sore
In a frenzied madness
with your leather and your spikes
Heads are bobbing all around
It is hot as hell tonight

Adrenaline starts to flow
You're thrashing all around
Acting like a maniac
Whiplash

Here on the stage the Marshal noise
is piercing through your ears
It kicks your ass kick your face
Exploding feeling nears
Now is the time to let it rip
To let it fuckin' loose
We are gathered here to be with you
Cause this is what we choose

Adrenaline starts to flow
You're thrashing all around
Acting like a maniac
Whiplash

The show is through the metal is gone
It is time to hit the road
Another town Another gig
Again we will explode
Hotel rooms and motorways
Life out here is raw
But we will never stop
We will never quit
cause we are Metallica

Adrenaline starts to flow
You're thrashing all around
Acting like a maniac


7. Phantom Lord

[James Hetfield]
[Lars Ulrich]
[D. Mustaine]

Sound is ripping through your ears
The deafening sound of metal nears
Your bodies waiting for his whips
The taste of leather on your lips

Hear the cry of War
Louder than before
With his sword in hand
to control the land
Crushing metal strikes
on this frightening night
Fall onto your knees
For the Phantom Lord

Victims falling under chains
You hear them crying dying pains
The fists of terrors breaking through
Now there's nothing you can do

Hear the cry of War
Louder than before
With his sword in hand
to control the land
Crushing metal strikes
on this frightening night
Fall onto your knees
For the Phantom Lord

The leather armies have prevailed
The Phantom Lord has never failed
Smoke is lifting from the ground
The rising volume metal sound

Hear the cry of War
Louder than before
With his sword in hand
to control the land
Crushing metal strikes
on this frightening night
Fall onto your knees
For the Phantom Lord

Fall to your knees
and bow to the PhantomLord


8. No Remorse

[James Hetfield]
[Lars Ulrich]

No mercy for what we are doing
No thought to even what we have done
We don't need to feel the sorrow
No remorse for the helpless one

War without end
No remorse No repent
We don't care what it meant
Another day Another death
Another sorrow Another breath
No remorse No repent
We don't care what it meant
Another day Another death
Another sorrow Another breath

Blood feeds the war machine
as it eats its way across the land
We don't need the feel the sorrow
No remorse is the one command

War without end
No remorse No repent
We don't care what it meant
Another day Another death
Another sorrow Another breath
No remorse No repent
We don't care what it meant
Another day Another death
Another sorrow Another breath

Only the strong survive
No one to save the weaker race
We are ready to kill all comers
Like a loaded gun right at your face

War without end
No remorse No repent
We don't care what it meant
Another day Another death
Another sorrow Another breath
No remorse No repent
We don't care what it meant
Another day Another death
Another sorrow Another breath

Attack
Bullets are flying
People are dying
with madness surrounding all hell's breaking loose
Soldiers are hounding
Bodies are mounting
cannons are shouting to take their abuse
With war machines going
Blood starts to flowing
No mercy given to anyone hear
The furious fighting
Swords are like lighting
It all becomes frightening to you
Know death is near
No remorse


9. Seek & Destroy

[James Hetfield]
[Lars Ulrich]

We are scanning the scene
in the city tonight
We are looking for you
to start up a fight
There is an evil feeling
in our brains
But it is nothing new
you know it drives us insane

Running,
On our way
Hiding,
You will pay
Dying,
One thousand deaths
Running,

There is no escape
and that is for sure
This is the end we won't take any more
Say goodbye

You have always been taking
but now you're giving

Running,
On our way
Hiding,
You will pay
Dying,
One thousand deaths
Running,
On our way
Hiding,
You will pay
Dying,
One thousand deaths
Searching,

Our brains are on fire
with the feeling to kill
And it won't go away
until our dreams are fulfilled
There is only one thing
on our minds
Don't try running away
`cause you're the one we will find

Running,
On our way
Hiding,
You will pay
Dying,
One thousand deaths
Running,
On our way
Hiding,
You will pay
Dying,
One thousand deaths
Searching,
Seek and Destroy
Searching,
Seek and Destroy
Searching,

[Lars Ulrich]
[D. Mustaine]

Thunder and lightning the gods take revenge
Senseless destruction
Victims of fury are cowardly now
Running for safety
Stabbing the harlot to pay for her sins
Leaving the virgin
Suicide running as if it were free
Ripping and tearing

We are trying to get the message to you
Metal Militia
Metal Militia
Metal Militia

Chained and shadowed to be left behind
nine and one thousand
Metal militia for your sacrifice
iron clad soldiers
Join or be conquered the law of the land
What will befall you
The metallization of your inner soul
twisting and turning

On through the mist and the madness
We are trying to get the message to you
Metal Militia
Metal Militia
Metal Militia

We are as one as we all are the same
fighting for one cause
Leather and metal are our uniforms

Joining together to take on the world
with our heavy metal
Spreading the message to everyone here
Come let yourself go

On through the mist and the madness
We are trying to get the message to you
Metal Militia
Metal Militia

[Metallica, originally performed by Diamond Head (Recorded in 1982)]
[- words and music by Brian Tatler and Sean Lindon Harris]

My mother was a witch, she was burned alive.
Thankless little bitch, for the tears I cried.
Take her down now, don't want to see her face
All blistered and burnt, can't hide my disgrace.

Twenty-seven, everyone was nice.
Gotta see 'em make 'em pay the price.
See their bodies out on the ice.
Take my time.

Am I evil? Yes I am.
Am I evil? I am man, yes I am.

As I watched my mother die, I lost my head.
Revenge now I sought, to break with my bread.
Taking no chances, you come with me.
I'll split you to the bone, help set you free.

Twenty-seven, everyone was nice.
Gotta see 'em make 'em pay the price.
See their bodies out on the ice.
Take my time.

Am I evil? Yes I am.
Am I evil? I am man, yes I am.

On with the action now, I'll strip your pride.
I'll spread your blood around, I'll see you ride.
Your face is scarred with steel, wounds deep and neat.
Like a double dozen before ya, smells so sweet.

Am I evil? Yes I am.
Am I evil? I am man.

I'll make my residence, I'll watch your fire.
You can come with me, sweet desire.
My face is long forgot, my face not my own.
Sweet and timely whore, take me home.

Am I evil? Yes I am.
Am I evil? I am man.

My soul is longing for, await my heir.
Sent to avenge my mother, sweep myself.
My face is long forgot, my face not my own.
Sweet and timely whore, take me home.

Am I evil? Yes I am.
Am I evil? I am man.

Am I evil? Yes I fucking am.
Am I evil? I am man, yeah.

[Metallica, originally performed by Blitzkrieg (Recorded in 1981)]
[- words and music by Ian Jones, Brian Smith and James Sirotto]

Let us have peace, let us have life,
Let us escape the cruel night.
Let us have time, let the sun shine,
Let us beware the deadly sign.

The day is coming, armageddon's near,
Inferno's coming, can we survive the blitzkrieg.
The blitzkrieg, the blitzkrieg.

Save us from fate, save us from hate,
Save ourselves before it's too late.
Come to our need, hear our plea,
Save ourselves before the earth bleeds.

The day is dawning, the time is near,
Aliens calling, can we survive the blitzkrieg.

1. Fight Fire With Fire

Do unto others as they have done unto you
But what in the hell is this world coming to?
Blow the universe into nothingness
Nuclear warfare shall lay us to rest

[chorus:]

Fight fire with fire
Ending is near
Fight fire with fire
Bursting with fear
We all shall die

Time is like a fuse, short and burning fast
Armageddon is here, like said in the past

[chorus:]

Soon to fill our lungs the hot winds of death
The gods are laughing, so take your last breath

[chorus:]


2. Ride The Lightning

Guilty as charged
But damn it, it ain't right
There is someone else controlling me
Death in the air
Strapped in the electric chair
This can't be happening to me
Who made you God to say
"I'll take your life from you!"

[chorus:]

Flash before my eyes
Now it's time to die
Burning in my brain
I can feel the flames

Wait for the sign
To flick the switch of death
It's the beginning of the end
Sweat, chilling cold
As I watch death unfold
Consciousness my only friend
My fingers grip with fear
What I am doing here?

[chorus:]

Someone help me
Oh please God help me
They are trying to take it all away
I don't want to die
Time moving slowly
The minutes seem like hours
The final curtain call I see
How true is this?
Just get it over with
If this is true, just let it be
Wakened by the horrid scream
Freed from the frightening dream

[chorus:]


3. For Whom The Bell Tolls

Make his fight on the hill in the early day
Constant chill deep inside
Shouting gun, on they run through the endless grey
On they fight, for the right, yes but who's to say?
For a hill men would kill why? They do not know
Stiffened wounds test their pride
Men of five, still alive through the raging glow
Gone insane from this pain that they surely know

For whom the bell tolls
Time marches on
For whom the bell tolls

Take a look to the sky just before you die
It is the last time you will
Blackened roar massive roar fills the crumbling sky
Shattered goal fills his soul with a ruthless cry
Stranger now, are his eyes, to this mystery
He hears the silence so loud
Crack of dawn, all is gone except the will to be
Now they will see what will be, blinded eyes to see

For whom the bell tolls
Time marches on
For whom the bell tolls


4. Fade To Black

Life it seems, will fade away
Drifting further every day
Getting lost within myself
Nothing matters no one else
I have lost the will to live
Simply nothing more to give
There is nothing more for me
Need the end to set me free

Things are not what they used to be
Missing one inside of me
Deathly lost, this can't be real
Cannot stand this hell I feel
Emptiness is filing me
To the point of agony
Growing darkness taking dawn
I was me, but now He's gone

No one but me can save myself, but it's too late
Now I can't think, think why I should even try
Yesterday seems as though it never existed
Death Greets me warm, now I will just say good-bye


5. Trapped Under Ice

I don't know how to live trough this hell
Woken up, I'm still locked in this shell
Frozen soul, frozen down to the core
Break the ice, I can't take anymore

Freezing
Can't move at all
Screaming
Can't hear my call
I am dying to live
Cry out
I'm trapped under the ice

Crystallized, as I lay here and rest
Eyes of glass stare directly at death
From deep sleep I have broken away
No one knows, no one hears what I say

Freezing
Can't move at all
Screaming
Can't hear my call
I am dying to live
Cry out
I'm trapped under the ice

Scream from my soul
Fate, mystified
Hell, forever more
No release from my cryonic state
What is this? I've been stricken by fate
Wrapped up tight, cannot move, can't break free
Hand of doom has a tight grip on me

Freezing
Can't move at all
Screaming
Can't hear my call
I am dying to live
Cry out
I'm trapped under the ice


6. Escape

Feel no pain, but my life ain't easy
I know I'm my best friend
No one cares, but I'm so much stronger
I'll fight until the end
To escape from the true false world
Undamaged destiny
Can't get caught in the endless circle
Ring of stupidity

Out of my own, out to be free
One with my mind, they just can't see
No need to hear things that they say
Life is for my own to live my own way

Rape my mind and destroy my feelings
Don't tell my what to do
I don't care now, 'cause I'm on my side
And I can see through you
Feed my brain with your so called standards
Who says that I ain't right
Break away from your common fashion
See through your blurry sight

Out of my own, out to be free
One with my mind, they just can't see
No need to hear things that they say
Life is for my own to live my own way

See they try to bring the hammer down
No damn chains can hold me to the ground
Life is for my own to live my own way


7. Creeping Death

Slaves
Hebrews born to serve, to the pharaoh
Heed
To his every word, live in fear
Faith
Of the unknown one, the deliverer
Wait
Something must be done, four hundred years

So let it be written
So let it be done
I'm sent here by the chosen one
So let it be written
So let it be done
To kill the first born pharaoh son
I'm creeping death

Now
Let my people go, land of goshen
Go
I will be with thee, bush of fire
Blood
Running red and strong, down the Nile
Plague
Darkness three days long, hail to fire

So let it be written
So let it be done
I'm sent here by the chosen one
So let it be written
So let it be done
To kill the first born pharaoh son
I'm creeping death

Die by my hand
I creep across the land
Killing first born man
Die by my hand
I creep across the land
Killing first born man

I
Rule the midnight air the destroyer
Born
I shall soon be there, deadly mass
I
Creep the steps and flood final darkness
Blood
Lambs blood painted door, I shall pass

So let it be written
So let it be done
I'm sent here by the chosen one
So let it be written
So let it be done
To kill the first born pharaoh son
I'm creeping death


8. The Call Of Ktulu

[Instrumental]

1. Battery

Lashing out the action, returning the reaction
Weak are ripped and torn away
Hypnotizing power, crushing all that cower
Battery is here to stay

Smashing through the boundaries
Lunacy has found me
Cannot stop the Battery
Pounding out aggression
Turns into obsession
Cannot kill the Battery

Cannot kill the family
Battery is found in me

Battery

Crushing all deceivers, mashing non-believers
Never ending potency
Hungry violence seeker, feeding off the weaker
Breeding on insanity

Smashing through the boundaries
Lunacy has found me
Cannot stop the Battery
Pounding out aggression
Turns into obsession
Cannot kill the Battery

Cannot kill the family
Battery is found in me

Battery

Circle of Destruction, Hammer comes crushing
Powerhouse of energy
Whipping up a fury, Dominating flurry
We create the Battery

Smashing through the boundaries
Lunacy has found me
Cannot stop the Battery
Pounding out aggression
Turns into obsession
Cannot kill the Battery

Cannot kill the family
Battery is found in me

Battery


2. Master Of Puppets

End of passion play, crumbling away
I'm your source of self-destruction
Veins that pump with fear, sucking dark is clear
Leading on your deaths construction

Taste me you will see
More is all you need
Dedicated to
How I'm killing you

Come crawling faster
Obey your Master
Your life burns faster
Obey your Master
Master

Master of Puppets I'm pulling your strings
Twisting your mind and smashing your dreams
Blinded by me, you can't see a thing
Just call my name, 'cause I'll hear you scream
Master
Master
Just call my name, 'cause I'll hear you scream
Master
Master

Needlework the way, never you betray
Life of death becoming clearer
Pain monopoly, ritual misery
Chop your breakfast on a mirror

Taste me you will see
More is all you need
Dedicated to
How I'm killing you

Come crawling faster
Obey your Master
Your life burns faster
Obey your Master
Master

Master of Puppets I'm pulling your strings
Twisting your mind and smashing your dreams
Blinded by me, you can't see a thing
Just call my name, 'cause I'll hear you scream
Master
Master
Just call my name, 'cause I'll hear you scream
Master
Master

Master, Master, where's the dreams that I've been after?
Master, Master, you promised only lies
Laughter, Laughter, all I hear or see is laughter
Laughter, Laughter, laughing at my cries
Hell is worth all that, natural habitat
Just a rhyme without a reason
Neverending maze, drift on numbered days
now your life is out of season
I will occupy
I will help you die
I will run through you
Now I rule you too

Come crawling faster
Obey your Master
Your life burns faster
Obey your Master
Master

Master of Puppets I'm pulling your strings
Twisting your mind and smashing your dreams
Blinded by me, you can't see a thing
Just call my name, 'cause I'll hear you scream
Master
Master
Just call my name, 'cause I'll hear you scream
Master
Master


3. The Thing That Should Not Be

Messenger of Fear in sight
Dark deception kills the light

Hybrid children watch the sea
Pray for Father, roaming free

Fearless Wretch
Insanity
He watches
Lurking beneath the sea
Great Old One
Forbidden site
He searches
Hunter of the Shadows is rising

Immortal
In madness You dwell

Crawling Chaos, underground
Cult has summoned, twisted sound

Out from ruins once possessed
Fallen city, living death

Fearless Wretch
Insanity
He watches
Lurking beneath the sea
Timeless sleep
Has been upset
He awakens
Hunter of the Shadows is rising

Immortal
In madness You dwell

Not dead which eternal lie
Stranger eons Death may die
Drain you of your sanity
Face The Thing That Should Not Be

Fearless Wretch
Insanity
He watches
Lurking beneath the sea
Great Old One
Forbidden site
He searches
Hunter of the Shadows is rising


4. Welcome Home (Sanitarium)

Welcome to where time stands still
No one leaves and no one will
Moon is full, never seems to change
Just labeled mentally deranged
Dream the same thing every night
I see our freedom in my sight
No locked doors, No windows barred
No things to make my brain seem scarred

Sleep my friend and you will see
That dream is my reality
They keep me locked up in this cage
Can't they see it's why my brain says Rage

Sanitarium, leave me be
Sanitarium, just leave me alone

Build my fear of what's out there
And cannot breathe the open air
Whisper things into my brain
Assuring me that I'm insane
They think our heads are in their hands
But violent use brings violent plans
Keep him tied, it makes him well
He's getting better, can't you tell?

No more can they keep us in
Listen, damn it, we will win
They see it right, they see it well
But they think this saves us from our hell

Sanitarium, leave me be
Sanitarium, just leave me alone
Sanitarium, just leave me alone

Fear of living on
Natives getting restless now
Mutiny in the air
Got some death to do
Mirror stares back hard
Kill, it's such a friendly word
Seems the only way
For reaching out again.


5. Disposable Heroes

Bodies fill the fields I see, hungry heroes end
No one to play soldier now, no one to pretend
Running blind through killing fields, bred to kill them all
Victim of what said should be
A servant 'til I fall

Soldier boy, made of clay
Now an empty shell
Twenty one, only son
But he served us well
Bred to kill, not to care
Do just as we say
Finished here, greeting death
He's yours to take away

Back to the front
You will do what I say, when I say
Back to the front
You will die when I say, you must die
Back to the front
You coward
You servant
You blind man

Barking of machine-gun fire, does nothing to me now
Sounding of the clock that ticks, get used to it somehow
More a man, more stripes you wear, glory seeker trends
Bodies fill the fields I see
The slaughter never ends

Soldier boy, made of clay
Now an empty shell
Twenty one, only son
But he served us well
Bred to kill, not to care
Do just as we say
Finished here, greeting death
He's yours to take away

Back to the front
You will do what I say, when I say
Back to the front
You will die when I say, you must die
Back to the front
You coward
You servant
You blind man

Why, am I dying?
Kill, have no fear
Lie, live off lying
Hell, Hell is here

Why, am I dying?
Kill, have no fear
Lie, live off lying
Hell, Hell is here

I was born for dying

Life planned out before my birth, nothing could I say
Had no chance to see myself, molded day by day
Looking back I realize, nothing have I done
Left to die with only friend
Alone I clench my gun

Soldier boy, made of clay
Now an empty shell
Twenty one, only son
But he served us well
Bred to kill, not to care
Do just as we say
Finished here, greeting death
He's yours to take away

Back to the front
You will do what I say, when I say
Back to the front
You will die when I say, you must die
Back to the front
You coward
You servant
You blind man

Back to the front.
Back to the front.
Back to the front.
Back to the front.
Back to the front.


6. Leper Messiah

Spineless from the start, sucked into the part
Circus comes to town, you play the lead clown
Please, please
Spreading his disease, living by his story
Knees, knees
Falling to your knees, suffer for his glory
You will

Time for lust, time for lie
Time to kiss your life goodbye
Send me money, send me green
Heaven you will meet
Make a contribution
And you'll get a better seat
Bow to Leper Messiah

Marvel at his tricks, need your Sunday fix
Blind devotion came, rotting your brain
Chain, chain
Join the endless chain
Taken by his glamour
Fame, Fame
Infection is the game, stinking drunk with power
We see

Time for lust, time for lie
Time to kiss your life goodbye
Send me money, send me green
Heaven you will meet
Make a contribution
And you'll get a better seat
Bow to Leper Messiah

Bow to Leper Messiah
Witchery, weakening
Sees the sheep are gathering
Set the trap, hypnotize
Now you follow

Time for lust, time for lie
Time to kiss your life goodbye
Send me money, send me green
Heaven you will meet
Make a contribution
And you'll get a better seat
Bow to Leper Messiah

Lie.

8. Damage, Inc.

Dealing out the agony within
Charging hard and no one's gonna give in
Living on your knees, conformity
Or dying on your feet for honesty
Inbred, our bodies work as one
Bloody, but never cry submission
Following our instinct not a trend
Go against the grain until the end

Blood will follow blood
Dying time is here
Damage Incorporated

Slamming through, don't fuck with razorback
Stepping out? You'll feel our hell on your back
Blood follows blood and we make sure
Life ain't for you and we're the cure
Honesty is my only excuse
Try to rob us of it, but it's no use
Steamroller action crushing all
Victim is your name and you shall fall

Blood will follow blood
Dying time is here
Damage Incorporated

We chew and spit you out
We laugh, you scream and shout
All flee, with fear you run
You'll know just where we come from

Damage Incorporated

Damage jackals ripping right through you
Sight and smell of this, it gets me goin'
Know just how to get just what we want
Tear it from your soul in nightly hunt
Fuck it all and fucking no regrets
Never happy ending on these dark sets
All's fair for Damage Inc. you see
Step a little closer if you please

Blood will follow blood
Dying time is here
Damage Incorporated

1. Helpless

I gotta see you moving fast
See you come my way
See the dreams, I hope they last
Never fade away.

Gotta see the lights above
Make it loud tonight
Gotta set it all a-fire
Set it all a-light

See the flashing lights
Hear the thunder roar
I am gonna set you all a-light
Gotta make it man
I ain't got a choice
Gotta fill this hall tonight

Helpless
Helpless
Helpless
Helpless

I don't what I'm gonna do
Maybe not tonight
Gotta set you all a-fire
Gotta treat you right.

I can see the flashing lights
Lit before your love, ohh
Gotta hear the thunder roar
Coming from above.

See the flashing lights
Hear the thunder roar
I'm gonna set you all alight
Gotta make it man
I ain't got no choice
Gotta fill this hall tonight

Helpless
Helpless
Helpless
Helpless

I can see the stars
I can see what's going on

Every night alone
I sing my song just for fun.

Only time will tell
If I'll make it myself someday
This stage is mine
Music is my destiny.

Cannot squeeze the life from me!

I can see the lights
But I can see what's going on
Every night alone
I sing my song just for fun.

Business in collapse
Some men don't like it so
Helpless maybe babe,
But you can leave or join the show.

Cannot squeeze the life from me!


2. The Small Hours

Look out at the darkness,
And you will see,
Just call my name and I'll be there.

You cannot touch me,
You would not dare,
I am the chill that's in the air.

[chorus]

And I try to get through to you,
In my own special way,
As the barriers crumble,
At the end of the day.

Dark rivers are flowing,
Back into the past,
You are the fish for which I cast.

And what of the future,
What is to be,
As the rivers flow into the sea.

[chorus]

Do not take for granted,
Powers out there,
Don't step into the demon's lair.

Time is an illusion,
Rising from time,
Steep is the mountain which we climb.


3. The Wait

Motives changing
Day to day
The fire increases
Masks decay
I look at the river
White foam floats down
The body's poisoned
Got to sit tight

The wait
The wait
The wait
The wait

After awakening
The silence grows
The screams subside
Distortion shows
Mutant thoughts
Of bad mouthed news
Just another birth
Of distorted views

The wait
The wait
The wait
The wait


4. Crash Course In Brain Surgery

Look inside and you will see
The words are cutting deep inside my brain
Thunder burnin' quickly burning
Knife of words is driving me insane, insane yeah

Raven black is on my track
He shows me how to neutralize the knife
Show to me in surgery
The art of fighting words to conquer life, conquer life yeah

Now the wicked lance of fear
Is driven from my heady moutain brain
Crash course in brain surgery
Has stopped the bloody knife of words again yeah, yeah, yeah


5. Last Caress / Green Hell

[Last Caress]

I've got somethin' to say
I killed your baby today and it
Doesn't matter much to me
As long as it's dead

Gonna bring
Green hell


1. Blackened

Blackened is the end
Winter it will send
Throwing all you see
Into obscurity

Death of Mother Earth
Never a rebirth
Evolution’s end
Never will it mend

Never

Fire
To begin whipping dance of the dead
Blackened is the end
To begin whipping dance of the dead
Color our world blackened

Blistering of earth
Terminate its worth
Deadly nicotine
Kills what might have been

Callous frigid chill
Nothing left to kill
Never seen before
Breathing nevermore

Never

Fire
To begin whipping dance of the dead
Blackened is the end
To begin whipping dance of the dead
Color our world blackened

Blackened

Opposition...contradiction...premonition...compromise
Agitation...violation...mutilation...planet dies

Darkest color
Blistered earth
True death of life

Termination...expiration...cancellation...human race
Expectation...liberation...population...lay to waste

See our mother
Put to death
See our mother die

Smoldering decay
Take her breath away
Millions of our years
In minutes disappears

Darkening in vain
Decadence remains
All is said and done
Never is the sun

Never

Fire
To begin whipping dance of the dead
Blackened is the end
To begin whipping dance of the dead
Fire
Is the outcome of hypocrisy
Darkest potency
In the exit of humanity
Color our world blackened

Blackened


2. ...And Justice For All

Halls of justice painted green
Money talking
Power wolves beset your door
Hear them stalking
Soon you’ll please their appetite
They devour
Hammer of justice crushes you
Overpower

The ultimate in vanity
Exploiting their supremacy
I can’t believe the things you say
I can’t believe
I can’t believe the price you pay
Nothing can save you

Justice is lost
Justice is raped
Justice is gone
Pulling your strings
Justice is done
Seeking no truth
Winning is all
Find it so grim
So true
So real

Apathy their stepping stone
So unfeeling
Hidden deep animosity
So deceiving
Through your eyes their light burns
Hoping to find
Inquisition sinking you
With prying minds

The ultimate in vanity
Exploiting their supremacy
I can’t believe the things you say
I can’t believe
I can’t believe the price you pay
Nothing can save you

Justice is lost
Justice is raped
Justice is gone
Pulling your strings
Justice is done
Seeking no truth
Winning is all
Find it so grim
So true
So real

Lady Justice has been raped
Truth assassin
Rolls of red tape seal your lips
Now you’re done in
Their money tips her scales again
Make your deal
Just what is truth? I cannot tell
Cannot feel

The ultimate in vanity
Exploiting their supremacy
I can’t believe the things you say
I can’t believe
I can’t believe the price you pay
Nothing can save you

Justice is lost
Justice is raped
Justice is gone
Pulling your strings
Justice is done
Seeking no truth
Winning is all
Find it so grim
So true
So real

Seeking no truth
Winning is all
Find it so grim
So true
So real


3. Eye Of The Beholder

Do you see what I see?
Truth is an offence
Your silence for your confidence

Do you hear what I hear?
Doors are slamming shut
Limit your imagination, keep you where they must

Do you feel what I feel?
Bittering distress
Who decides what you express?

Do you take what I take?
Endurance is the word
Moving back instead of forward seems to me absurd

Doesn’t matter what you see
Or into it what you read
You can do it your own way
If it’s done just how I say

Independence limited
Freedom of choice
Choice is made for you, my friend
Freedom of speech
Speech is words that they will bend
Freedom with their exception

Do you fear what I fear?
Living properly
Truths to you are lies to me

Do you choose what I choose?
More alternatives
Energy derives from both the plus and negative

Do you need what I need?
Boundaries overthrown
Look inside, to each his own

Do you trust what I trust?
Me, myself and I
Penetrate the smoke screen, I see through the selfish lie

Doesn’t matter what you see
Or into it what you read
You can do it your own way
If it’s done just how I say

Independence limited
Freedom of choice
Choice is made for you, my friend
Freedom of speech
Speech is words that they will bend
Freedom with their exception

Do you know what I know?
Your money and your wealth
Your silence just to hear yourself

Do you want what I want?
Desire not a thing
I hunger after independence, lengthen freedom’s ring

Doesn’t matter what you see
Or into it what you read
You can do it your own way
If it’s done just how I say

Independence limited
Freedom of choice
Choice is made for you, my friend
Freedom of speech
Speech is words that they will bend
Freedom no longer frees you
Doesn’t matter what you see
Or into it what you read
You can do it your own way
If it’s done just how I say


4. One

I can’t remember anything
Can’t tell if this is true or dream
Deep down inside I feel to scream
This terrible silence stops me

Now that the war is through with me
I’m waking up, I cannot see
That there’s not much left of me
Nothing is real but pain now

Hold my breath as I wish for death
Oh please, God, wake me

Back in the womb it’s much too real
In pumps life that I must feel
But can’t look forward to reveal
Look to the time when I’ll live

Fed through the tube that sticks in me
Just like a wartime novelty
Tied to machines that make me be
Cut this life off from me

Hold my breath as I wish for death
Oh please, God, wake me

Now the world is gone, I’m just one
Oh God, help me Hold my breath as I wish for death
Oh please, God, help me

Darkness
Imprisoning me
All that I see
Absolute horror
I cannot live
I cannot die
Trapped in myself
Body my holding cell

Landmine
Has taken my sight
Taken my speech
Taken my hearing
Taken my arms
Taken my legs
Taken my soul
Left me with life in hell


5. The Shortest Straw

Suspicion is your name
Your honesty to blame
Put dignity to shame
Dishonor
Witchhunt, modern day
Determining decay
The blatant disarray
Disfigure
The public eye’s disgrace
Defying common place
Unending paper chase
Unending

Deafening
Painstaking
Reckoning
This vertigo it doth bring

Shortest straw
Challenge liberty
Downed by law
Live in infamy
Rub you raw
Witchhunt riding through
Shortest straw
The shortest straw has been pulled for you

Pulled for you
Shortest straw
Pulled for you
Shortest straw
Pulled for you
Shortest straw
The shortest straw has been pulled for you

The accusations fly
Discrimination, why?
Your inner self to die
Intruding
Doubt sunk itself in you
Its teeth and talons through
You’re living Catch-22
Deluding
A mass hysteria
A megalomania
Reveal dementia
Reveal

Secretly
Silently
Certainly
In vertigo you will be

Shortest straw
Challenge liberty
Downed by law
Live in infamy
Rub you raw
Witchhunt riding through
Shortest straw
This shortest straw has been pulled for you

Pulled for you
Shortest straw
Pulled for you
Shortest straw
Pulled for you
Shortest straw
Shortest straw has been pulled for you
Shortest straw
Pulled for you
Shortest straw
Pulled for you
Shortest straw
Pulled for you
Shortest straw
Shortest straw has been pulled for you

Behind you, hands are tied
Your being, ostracized
Your hell is multiplied
Upending
The fallout has begun
Oppressive damage done
Your many turned to none
To nothing
You’re reaching your nadir
Your will has disappeared
The lie is crystal clear
Defending

Channels red
One word said
Blacklisted
With vertigo make you dead

Shortest straw
Challenge liberty
Downed by law
Live in infamy
Rub you raw
Witchhunt riding through
Shortest straw
The shortest straw has been pulled for you
Pulled for you


6. Harvester Of Sorrow

My life suffocates
Planting seeds of hate
I’ve loved, turned to hate
Trapped far beyond my fate

I give, you take
This life that I forsake
Been cheated of my youth
You turned this lie to truth

Anger
Misery
You’ll suffer unto me

Harvester of sorrow
Language of the mad
Harvester of sorrow

Pure black, looking clear
My work is done soon here
Try getting back to me
Get back which used to be

Drink up
Shoot in
Let the beatings begin
Distributor of pain
Your loss becomes my gain

Anger
Misery
You’ll suffer unto me

Harvester of sorrow
Language of the mad
Harvester of sorrow

All have said their prayers
Invade their nightmares
To see into my eyes
You’ll find where murder lies

Infanticide

Harvester of sorrow
Language of the mad
Harvester of sorrow
Language of the mad
Harvester of sorrow


7. The Frayed Ends Of Sanity

Never hunger
Never prosper
I have fallen prey to failure
Struggle within
Triggered again
Now the candle burns at both ends

Twisting under schizophrenia
Falling deep into dementia

Old habits reappear
Fighting the fear of fear
Growing conspiracy
Everyone’s after me
Frayed ends of sanity
Hear them calling
Hear them calling me

Birth of terror
Death of much more
I’m the slave of fear, my captor
Never warnings
Spreading its wings
As I wait for the horror she brings

Loss of interest, question, wonder
Waves of fear they pull me under

Old habits reappear
Fighting the fear of fear
Growing conspiracy
Everyone’s after me
Frayed ends of sanity
Hear them calling
Hear them calling me

Into ruin
I am sinking
Hostage of this nameless feeling
Hell is set free
Flooded I’ll be
Feel the undertow inside me

Height, hell, time, haste, terror, tension
Life, death, want, waste, mass depression

Old habits reappear
Fighting the fear of fear
Growing conspiracy
Myself is after me
Frayed ends of sanity
Hear them calling
Frayed ends of sanity
Hear them calling
Hear them calling me


8. To Live Is To Die

When a man lies he murders some part of the world
These are the pale deaths which men miscall their lives
All this I cannot bear to witness any longer
Cannot the kingdom of salvation take me home


9. Dyers Eve

Dear Mother
Dear Father
What is this hell you have put me through
Believer
Deceiver
Day in, day out, live my life through you
Pushed onto me what’s wrong or right
Hidden from this thing that they call life

Dear Mother
Dear Father
Every thought I’d think you’d disapprove
Curator
Dictator
Always censoring my every move
Children are seen but are not heard
Tear out everything inspired

Innocence
Torn from me without your shelter
Barred reality
I’m living blindly

Dear Mother
Dear Father
Time has frozen still what’s left to be
Hear nothing
Say nothing
Cannot face the fact I think for me
No guarantee, it’s life as is
But damn you for not giving me my chance

Dear Mother
Dear Father
You’ve clipped my wings before I learned to fly
Unspoiled
Unspoken
I’ve outgrown that fucking lullaby
Same thing I’ve always heard from you
Do as I say, not as I do

Innocence
Torn from me without your shelter
Barred reality
I’m living blindly

I’m in hell without you
Cannot cope without you two
Shocked at the world that I see
Innocent victim please rescue me

Dear Mother
Dear Father
Hidden in your world you’ve made for me
I’m seething
I’m bleeding
Ripping wounds in me that never heal
Undying spite I feel for you
Living out this hell you always knew

1. Enter Sandman

[Hetfield / Ulrich / Hammet]

Say your prayers little one
Don't forget, my son,
To include everyone

Tuck you in, warm within
Keep you free from sin
Till the sandman he comes

Sleep with one eye open
Gripping your pillow tight

Exit light
Enter night
Take my hand
Off to never never land

Something's wrong, shut the light
Heavy thoughts tonight
And they aren't of snow white

Dreams of war, dreams of liars
Dreams of dragon's fire
And of things that will bite

Sleep with one eye open
Gripping your pillow tight

Exit light
Enter night
Take my hand
Off to never never land

Now I lay me down to sleep
Pray the lord my soul to keep
If I die before I wake
Pray the lord my soul to take

Hush, little baby, don't say a word
And never mind that noise you heard
It's just the beast under your bed,
In your closet, in your head

Exit light
Enter night
Grain of sand

Exit light
Enter night
Take my hand
Off to never never land


2. Sad But True

[Hetfield / Ulrich]

Hey
I'm your life
I'm the one who takes you there
Hey
I'm your life
I'm the one who cares
They
They betray
I'm your only true friend now
They
They'll betray
I'm forever there

I'm your dream, make you real
I'm your eyes when you must steal
I'm your pain when you can't feel
Sad but true

I'm your dream, mind astray
I'm your eyes while you're away
I'm your pain while you repay
You know it's sad but true

Sad but true

You
You're my mask
You're my cover, my shelter
You
You're my mask
You're the one who's blamed
Do
Do my work
Do my dirty work, scapegoat
Do
Do my deeds
For you're the one who's shamed

I'm your dream, make you real
I'm your eyes when you must steal
I'm your pain when you can't feel
Sad but true

I'm your dream, mind astray
I'm your eyes while you're away
I'm your pain while you repay
You know it's sad but true

Sad but true

[2x]
I'm your dream
I'm your eyes
I'm your pain

You know it's sad but true

Hate
I'm your hate
I'm your hate when you want love
Pay
Pay the price
Pay, for nothing's fair

Hey
I'm your life
I'm the one who took you there
Hey
I'm your life
And I no longer care

I'm your dream, make you real
I'm your eyes when you must steal
I'm your pain when you can't feel
Sad but true

I'm your truth, telling lies
I'm your reasoned alibis
I'm inside open your eyes
I'm you

Sad but true


3. Holier Than Thou

[Hetfield / Ulrich]

No more!
The craps rolls out your mouth again
Haven't changed, your brain is still gelatin
Little whispers circle around your head
Why don't you worry about yourself instead

Who are you? Where ya been? Where ya from?
Gossip is burning on the tip of your tongue
You lie so much you believe yourself
Judge not lest ye be judged yourself

Holier than thou
You are
Holier than thou
You are

You know not

Before you judge me take a look at you
Can't you find something better to do
Point the finger, slow to understand
Arrogance and ignorance go hand in hand

It's not who you are it's who you know
Others lives are the basis of your own
Burn your bridges build them back with wealth
Judge not lest ye be judged yourself

Holier than thou
You are
Holier than thou
You are

You know not


4. The Unforgiven

[Hetfield / Ulrich / Hammet]

New blood joins this earth,
And quickly he's subdued.
Through constant pained disgrace
The young boy learns their rules.

With time the child draws in.
This whipping boy done wrong.
Deprived of all his thoughts
The young man struggles on and on.

He's known a vow unto his own,
That never from this day
His will they'll take away.

What I've felt,
What I've known
Never shined through in what I've shown.
Never be.
Never see.
Won't see what might have been.

What I've felt,
What I've known
Never shined through in what I've shown.
Never free.
Never me.
So I dub thee unforgiven.

They dedicate their lives
To running all of his.
He tries to please them all –
This bitter man he is.

Throughout his life the same –
He's battled constantly.
This fight he cannot win –
A tired man they see no longer cares.

The old man then prepares
To die regretfully –
That old man here is me.

What I've felt,
What I've known
Never shined through in what I've shown.
Never be.
Never see.
Won't see what might have been.

What I've felt,
What I've known
Never shined through in what I've shown.
Never free.
Never me.
So I dub thee unforgiven.

[Solo]

What I've felt,
What I've known
Never shined through in what I've shown.
Never be.
Never see.
Won't see what might have been.

What I've felt,
What I've known
Never shined through in what I've shown.
Never free.
Never me.
So I dub thee unforgiven.

Never free.
Never me.
So I dub thee unforgiven.

You labelled me,
I'll label you.
So I dub thee unforgiven.

Never free.
Never me.
So I dub thee unforgiven.

You labelled me,
I'll label you.
So I dub thee unforgiven.

Never free.
Never me.
So I dub thee unforgiven.


5. Wherever I May Roam

[Hetfield / Ulrich]

(...and the road becomes my bride)⟓
...and the road becomes my bride
I have stripped of all but pride
So in her I do confide
And she keeps me satisfied
Gives me all I need

...and with dust in throat I crave
Only knowledge will I save
To the game you stay a slave

Rover, wanderer
Nomad, vagabond
Call me what you will

But I'll take my time anywhere
Free to speak my mind anywhere
And I'll redefine anywhere
Anywhere I may roam
Where I lay my head is home

(...and the Earth becomes my throne)
...and the Earth becomes my throne
I adapt to the unknown
Under wandering stars I've grown
By myself but not alone
I ask no one

...and my ties are severed clean
The less I have the more I gain
Off the beaten path I reign

Rover, wanderer
Nomad, vagabond
Call me what you will

But I'll take my time anywhere
I'm free to speak my mind anywhere
And I'll never mind anywhere
Anywhere I may roam
Where I lay my head is home

But I'll take my time anywhere
I'm free to speak my mind anywhere
And I'll never mind anywhere
Anywhere I may roam
Where I lay my head is home, that's right

[Solo]

But I'll take my time anywhere
I'm free to speak my mind
And I'll take my find anywhere
Anywhere I may roam
Where I lay my head is home

Carved upon my stone
My body lie, but still I roam

Wherever I may roam
Wherever I may roam
Wherever I may roam, yeah
Wherever I may wander, wander, wander
Wherever I may roam
Yeah, yeah! Wherever I may roam
Yeah, yeah! Wherever I may roam
Wherever I may roam
Wherever I may roam…


6. Don't Tread On Me

[Hetfield / Ulrich]

Liberty or death, what we so proudly hail
Once you provoke her, rattling of her tail
Never begins it, never, but once engaged...
Never surrenders, showing the fangs of rage

Don't tread on me

So be it
Threaten no more
To secure peace is to prepare for war
So be it
Settle the score
Touch me again for the words that you'll hear evermore...

Don't tread on me

Love it or live it, she with the deadly bite
Quick is the blue tongue, forked as lighting strike
Shining with brightness, always on surveillance
The eyes, they never close, emblem of vigilance

Don't tread on me

So be it
Threaten no more
To secure peace is to prepare for war
So be it
Settle the score
Touch me again for the words that you'll hear evermore...

Don't tread on me

So be it
Threaten no more
To secure peace is to prepare for war

Liberty or death, what we so proudly hail
Once you provoke her, rattling on her tail

So be it
Threaten no more
To secure peace is to prepare for war
So be it
Settle the score
Touch me again for the words that you'll hear evermore...

Don't tread on me


7. Through The Never

[Hetfield / Ulrich / Hammet]

All that is, was and will be
Universe much too big to see

Time and space never ending
Disturbing thoughts, questions pending
Limitations of human understanding
Too quick to criticize
Obligation to survive
We hunger to be alive

All that is, ever
Ever was
Will be ever
Twisting
Turning
Through the never

In the dark, see past our eyes
Pursuit of truth no matter where it lies

Gazing up to the breeze of the heavens
On a quest, meaning, reason
Came to be, how it begun
All alone in the family of the sun
Curiosity teasing everyone
On our home, third stone from the sun

All that is, ever
Ever was
Will be ever
Twisting
Turning
Through the never

On through the never
We must go
On through the never
Out of the
Edge of forever
We must go
On through the never
Then ever comes

All that is, ever
Ever was
Will be ever
Who we are
Ask forever
Twisting
Turning
Through the never

Never


8. Nothing Else Matters

[Hetfield / Ulrich / Hammet]

So close no matter how far
Couldn't be much more from the heart
Forever trusting who we are
And nothing else matters

Never opened myself this way
Life is ours, we live it our way
All these words I don't just say
And nothing else matters

Trust I seek and I find in you
Every day for us something new
Open mind for a different view
And nothing else matters

Never cared for what they do
Never cared for what they know
But I know

So close no matter how far
Couldn't be much more from the heart
Forever trusting who we are
And nothing else matters

Never cared for what they do
Never cared for what they know
But I know

Never opened myself this way
Life is ours, we live it our way
All these words I don't just say
And nothing else matters

Trust I seek and I find in you
Every day for us something new
Open mind for a different view
And nothing else matters

Never cared for what they say
Never cared for games they play
Never cared for what they do
Never cared for what they know
And I know

[Solo]

So close no matter how far
Couldn't be much more from the heart
Forever trusting who we are
No, nothing else matters


9. Of Wolf And Man

[Hetfield / Ulrich / Hammet]

Off through the new day's mist I run
Off from the new day's mist I have come
I hunt
Therefore I am
Harvest the land
Taking of the fallen lamb

Off through the new day's mist I run
Off from the new day's mist I have come
We shift
Pulsing with the earth
Company we keep
Roaming the land while you sleep

Shape shift nose to the wind
Shape shift feeling I've been
Move swift all senses clean
Earth's gift back to the meaning of life

Bright is the moon high in starlight
Chill is the air cold as steel tonight
We shift
Call of the wild
Fear in your eyes
It's later than you realized

Shape shift nose to the wind
Shape shift feeling I've been
Move swift all senses clean
Earth's gift back to the meaning of life

I feel I change
Back to a better day
Hair stands on the back of my neck
In wildness is the preservation of the world

So seek the wolf in thyself

Shape shift nose to the wind
Shape shift feeling I've been
Move swift all senses clean
Earth's gift
Back to the meaning of wolf and man


10. The God That Failed

[Hetfield / Ulrich]

Pride you took
Pride you feel
Pride that you felt when you'd kneel

Not the word
Not the love
Not what you thought from above

It feeds
It grows
It clouds all that you will know
Deceit
Deceive
Decide just what you believe

I see faith in your eyes
Never your hear the discouraging lies
I hear faith in your cries
Broken is the promise, betrayal
The healing hand held back by the deepened nail

Follow the god that failed

Find your peace
Find your say
Find the smooth road in your way

Trust you gave
A child to save
Left you cold and him in grave

It feeds
It grows
It clouds all that you will know
Deceit
Deceive
Decide just what you believe

I see faith in your eyes
Never you hear the discouraging lies
I hear faith in your cries
Broken is the promise, betrayal
The healing hand held back by the deepened nail

Follow the god that failed

I see faith in your eyes
Broken is the promise, betrayal
The healing hand held back by the deepened nail

Follow the god that failed

Pride you took
Pride you feel
Pride that you felt when you'd kneel

Trust you gave
A child to save
Left you cold and him in grave

I see faith in your eyes
Never you hear the discouraging lies
I hear faith in your cries
Broken is the promise, betrayal
The healing hand held back by deepened nail

Follow the god that failed


11. My Friend Of Misery

[Hetfield / Ulrich / Newsted]

You just stood there screaming
Fearing no one was listening to you
They say the empty can rattles the most
The sound of your voice must soothe you
Hearing only what you want to hear
And knowing only what you've heard
You you're smothered in tragedy
You're out to save the world

Misery
You insist that the weight of the world
Should be on your shoulders
Misery
There's much more to life than what you see
My friend of misery

You still stood there screaming
No one caring about these words you tell
My friend before your voice is gone
One man's fun is another's hell
These times are sent to try men's souls
But something's wrong with all you see
You you'll take it on all yourself
Remember, misery loves company

Misery
You insist that the weight of the world
Should be on your shoulders
Misery
There's much more to life than what you see
My friend of misery

You just stood there screaming
My friend of misery


12. The Struggle Within

[Hetfield / Ulrich]

Reaching out for something you've got to feel
While clutching to what you had thought was real

Kicking at a dead horse pleases you
No way of showing your gratitude
So many things you don't want to do
What is it? What have you got to lose

What the hell
What is you think you're gonna find?
Hypocrite
Boredom sets into the boring mind

Struggle within it suits you fine
Struggle within your ruin
Struggle within you seal your own coffin
Struggle within the struggling within

Home is not a home it becomes a hell
Turning it into your prison cell
Advantages are taken, not handed out
While you struggle inside your hell

Reaching out
Grabbing for something you've got to feel
Closing in
The pressure upon you is so real

Struggle within it suits you fine
Struggle within your ruin
Struggle within you seal your own coffin
Struggle within the struggling within

Reaching out for something you've got to feel
While clutching to what you had thought was real
What the hell

What is you think you're gonna find
Hypocrite
Boredom sets into the boring mind

Struggle within it suits you fine
Struggle within your ruin
Struggle within you seal your own coffin
Struggle within the struggling within


1. Ain't My Bitch

Outta my way
Outta my day
Out of your mind and into mine

Into no one
Into not one
Into your step but out of time

Headstrong
What's wrong?
I've already heard this song before
You arrived, but now it's time to kiss your ass goodbye

Dragging me down
Why you around?
So useless

It ain't my fall
It ain't my call
It ain't my bitch
It ain't my bitch

Down on the sun
Down and no fun
Down and out, where the hell you been?

Damn it all down
Damn it unbound
Damn it all down to hell again

Stand tall
Can't fall
Never even bend at all before
You arrived, but now it's time to kiss your ass goodbye

Dragging me down
Why you around?
So useless

It ain't my fall
It ain't my call
It ain't my bitch

Outta my way

Outta my way
Outta my day
Out of your mind and into mine

Into no one
Into not one
Into your step but out of time

Headstrong
What's wrong?
I've already heard this song before
You arrived, but now it's time to kiss your ass goodbye
And now it's time to kiss your ass goodbye

Dragging me down
Why you around?
So useless

It ain't my fall
It ain't my call
It ain't my bitch

No way but down
Why you're around?
No fooling

It ain't my smile
It ain't my style
It ain't my bitch
Oh, it ain't mine

Ain't mine
Your kind
You're stepping out of time

Ain't mine
Your kind
You're stepping out of time

Taking me down
Why you around?
No fooling

It ain't my fall
It ain't my call
It ain't my bitch
You ain't mine


2. 2 x 4

I'm gonna make you, shake you, take you
I'm gonna be the one who breaks you
Put the screws to you, yeah, my way
Yeah, come on and come on, come and make my day
Make my day

Got some hell to pay, I steal your thunder
The joy of violent movement pulls you under
Bite the bullet, well, hard
Yeah, but I die harder, so go too far
Too far

Friction, fusion, retribution
I can't hear you talk to me
I can't hear you. So talk to me
I can't hear you. Are you talking to me?
I can't hear you. Are you talking to me?
I can't hear you. Time to meet my lord
I can't hear you talk to two by four

I'm gonna make you, shake you, take you
I'm gonna be the one who breaks you
Put the screws to you, my way
Hey, come on and come on, come and make my day
Make my day

Friction, fusion, retribution
I can't hear you talk to me
I can't hear you. Come talk to me
I can't hear you. Are you talking to me?
I can't hear you. Are you talking to me?
I can't hear you. Time to meet my lord
I can't hear you talk to two by four

Talk to two by four
It don't take no more

Friction, fusion, retribution
I'm gonna make you talk to me
I'm gonna trick you. So talk to me
I can't hear you. Are you talking to me?
I can't hear you. You talking to me?
I can't hear you. Time to meet my lord
I can't hear you talk to two by four
She don't take no more


3. The House Jack Built

Open door, so I walk inside
Close my eyes, find my place to hide
And I shake as I take it in
Let the show begin

Open my eyes just to have them close again
Well on my way, but on my way to where I've been
It swallows me as it takes me in its fog
I twist away as I give this world the nod

Open door, so I walk inside
Close my eyes, find my place to hide
And I shake as I take it in
Let the show begin

Open my eyes just to have them closed once again
Don't want control
As it takes me down and down and down again
Is that the moon or just a light that lights this dead-end street?
Is that you there or just another demon that I meet?

The higher you are
The farther you fall
The longer the walk
The farther you crawl
My body, my temple
This temple, it tilts
Step into the house that Jack built

The higher you are
The farther you fall
The longer the walk
The farther you crawl
My body, my temple
This temple, it tilts
Yes, this is the house that Jack built

Open door, yes, I walk inside
Swallow me so the pain subsides
And I shake as I take the sin
Let the show begin

Let the show begin
Let the show begin

The higher you are
The farther you fall
The longer the walk
The farther you crawl
My body, my temple
This temple, it tilts
Yes, this is the house that Jack built

The higher you are
The farther you fall
The longer the walk
The farther you crawl
My body, my temple
This temple, it tilts
Yes, I am, I am, I am

Open my eyes
It swallows me
Is that you there
I twist away
Away
Away
Away


4. Until It Sleeps

Where do I take this pain of mine?
I run, but it stays right by my side

So tear me open, pour me out
There's things inside that scream and shout
And the pain still hates me
So hold me until it sleeps

Just like the curse, just like the stray
You feed it once and now it stays
Now it stays

So tear me open but beware
There's things inside without a care
And the dirt still stains me
So wash me until I'm clean

It grips you, so hold me
It stains you, so hold me
It hates you, so hold me
It holds you, so hold me
Until it sleeps (until it sleeps, until it sleeps)

So tell me why you've chosen me
Don't want your grip
Don't want your greed
Don't want it

I'll tear me open, make you gone
No more can you hurt anyone
And the fear still shakes me
So hold me until it sleeps

It grips you, so hold me
It stains you, so hold me
It hates you, so hold me
It holds you, holds you, holds you
Until it sleeps

I don't want it

So tear me open but beware
There's things inside without a care
And the dirt still stains me
So wash me 'til clean

I'll tear me open, make you gone
No longer will you hurt anyone
And the hate still shapes me
So hold me until it sleeps
Until it sleeps


5. King Nothing

Wish I may, wish I might
Have this I wish tonight
Are you satisfied?
Dig for gold, dig for fame
You dig to make your name
Are you pacified?

All the wants you waste
All the things you've chased

And it all crashes down
And you break your crown
And you point your finger
But there's no one around

Just want one thing
Just to play the king
But the castle's crumbled
And you're left with just a name

Where's your crown, King Nothing?
Where's your crown?

Hot and cold, bought and sold
A heart as hard as gold
Are you satisfied?
Wish I might, wish I may
You wish your life away
Are you pacified?

All the wants you waste
All the things you've chased

Then it all crashes down
And you break your crown
And you point your finger
But there's no one around

Just want one thing
Just to play the king
But the castle's crumbled
And you're left with just a name

Where's your crown, King Nothing?
Yeah, nothing.
Oh, where's your crown?

I wish I may, I wish I might
Have this wish I wish tonight
I want that star, I want it now
I want it all and I don't care how

Careful what you wish
Careful what you say
Careful what you wish, you may regret it
Careful what you wish, you just might get it

Then it all crashes down
And you break your crown
And you point your finger
But there's no one around

Just want one thing
Just to play the king
But the castle's crumbled
And you're left with just a name

Where's your crown, King Nothing?

Nothing

No, you're just nothing
Where's your crown, King Nothing?
No, you're just nothing
Absolutely nothing

Off to Never-Never land


6. Hero Of The Day

Mama, they try and break me

The window burns to light the way back home
A light that warms no matter where they've gone
They're off to find the hero of the day
But what if they should fall by someone's wicked way?

Still the window burns
Time so slowly turns
And someone there is sighing
Keepers of the flames
Do you feel your name?
Did you hear your babies crying?

Mama, they try and break me
Still they try and break me

Excuse me while I tend to how I feel
These things return to me that still seem real
Now, deservingly, this easy chair
But the rocking stopped by wheels of despair

Don't want your aid
But the fist I make
For years can't hold or feel
No, I'm not all me
So please excuse me while I tend to how I feel

But now the dreams and waking screams
That ever last the night
So build the wall, behind it crawl
And hide until it's light
So can you hear your babies crying now?

[Solo]

Still the window burns
Time so slowly turns
And someone there is sighing
Keepers of the flames
Did you feel your names?
Did you hear your babies crying?

But now the dreams and waking screams
That ever last the night
So build a wall, behind it crawl
And hide until it's light
So can't you hear your babies crying now?

[2x]
Mama, they try and break me
Mama, they try and break me
Mama, they try and break me
Mama they try
Mama they try


7. Bleeding Me

I'm diggin' my way
I'm diggin' my way to something
I'm diggin' my way to somethin' better

I'm pushin' to stay
I'm pushin' to stay with something
I'm pushin' to stay with something better

I'm sowing the seeds
I'm sowing the seeds I've taken
I'm sowing the seeds I take for granted

This thorn in my side
This thorn in my side is from the tree
This thorn in my side is from the tree I've planted

It tears me and I bleed
And I bleed

Caught under wheel's roll
I take the leech I'm bleeding me
Can't stop to save my soul
I take the leash that's leading me
I'm bleeding me
I can't take it
Caught under wheel's roll
The bleeding of me
Of me
The bleeding of me

Caught under wheel's roll
I take the leech I'm bleeding me
Can't stop to save my soul
I take the leash that's leading me
I'm bleeding me
I can't take it
Caught under wheel's roll
The bleeding of me
The bleeding of me

I am the beast that feeds the feast
I am the blood, I am release
Come make me pure
Bleed me a cure
I'm caught, I'm caught, I'm caught under

Caught under wheel's roll
I take that leech I'm bleeding me
Can't stop to save my soul
I take the leash that's leading me
I'm bleeding me
I can't take it, I can't take it, I can't take it
The bleeding of me

Come on
Bleed me

I'm digging my way
I'm digging my way to something
I'm digging my way to something better

I'm pushing to stay
I'm pushing to stay with something
I'm pushing to stay with something better

With something better


8. Cure

The man takes another bullet
He keeps them all within
He must seek no matter how it hurts
So don't fool again

He thinks the answer's cold and in his hand
He takes his medicine
The man takes another bullet
He's been fooled again

Uncross your arms
Take and throw them to the cure, say,
"I do believe."

Uncross your arms now
Take them to it, say
"I do believe."
"I do believe."

The lies tempt her and she follows
Again she lets him in
She must believe to fill the hollow
She's been fooled again

Uncross your arms
Take and throw them to the cure, say
"I do believe."

Uncross your arms now
Take them to it, say,
"I do believe."
"Yeah, I do believe."

Betting on the cure
It must get better than this
Betting on the cure
Everyone's got to have the sickness
'Cause everyone seems to need the cure
Precious cure

Betting on the cure
'Cause it must get better than this
Betting on the cure
Everyone's got to have the sickness
'Cause everyone seems to need the cure
Precious cure

"I do believe."

Betting on the cure
It must get better than this
Need to feel secure
It's got to get better than this
It must get better than this
Betting on the cure
Everyone's got to have the sickness
'Cause everyone seems to need the cure

"I do believe."


9. Poor Twisted Me

Oh, poor twisted me
Oh, poor twisted me
I feast on sympathy
I chew on suffer
I chew on agony

Swallow whole the pain
Oh, it's too good to be
That all this misery
Is just for, oh, poor twisted me
Poor twisted me

Poor mistreated me
Poor mistreated me
I drown without a sea
Lungs fill with sorrow
Lungs fill with misery

Inhaling the deep, dark blue
Oh, woe is me
Such a burden to be
The poor mistreated me

To finally reach the shore, survive the storm
Now you're bare and cold, the sea was warm
So warm, you bathe your soul again

Baby, again and again and again

You finally reached the shore, survived the storm
Now you're bare and cold, the sea was warm
So warm, you bathe your soul again

Good to feel my friend
Oh, woe is me
Such a burden to be
Oh, poor twisted me
Yo, poor twisted me


10. Wasting My Hate

Good day. How do?
And I send a smile to you
Don't waste, waste your breath
And I won't waste my hate on you

Ain't gonna waste my hate
Ain't gonna waste my hate on you
I think I'll keep it for myself

Ain't gonna give no more
Ain't got the time to help you score
I think it's time you pleased yourself
Yourself

Good day. How do?
And I send a smile to you
Don't waste, waste your breath
And I won't waste my hate on you
Waste my hate on you
Hate

You think you're worthy now?
You think enough to even raise the brow
And to laugh and tip that two-pronged crown?

Well I see my hands, I see my feet
I feel that blood that pumps in beat
But where the hell's my mind going now?
Dead gone now

Good day. How do?
And I send a smile to you
Don't waste, waste your breath
And I won't waste my hate on you
Waste my hate on you

Think I'll keep it for myself

Hate

Ain't gonna waste my hate
But I'm so greedy when they say
Better to give than to receive

Ain't gonna waste my hate, no, no
Ain't got time to waste my hate on you
I think I'll keep it all for myself
For myself

Good day. How do?
And I send a smile to you
Don't waste, waste your breath
And I won't waste my hate on you
Waste my hate on you

Think I'll keep it for myself, yeah!

Uh, hate


11. Mama Said

Mama, she has taught me well
Told me when I was young,
"Son, your life's an open book.
Don't close it 'fore it's done.
The brightest flame burns quickest."
That's what I heard her say
A son's heart's owed to mother
But I must find my way

Let my heart go
Let your son grow
Mama, let my heart go
Or let this heart be still

"Rebel", my new last name
Wild blood in my veins
Apron strings around my neck
The mark that still remains
I left home at an early age
Of what I heard was wrong
I never asked forgiveness
But what is said is done

Let my heart go
Let your son grow
Mama, let my heart go
Or let this heart be still

Never I ask of you
But never I gave
But you gave me your emptiness
I now take to my grave
Never I ask of you
But never I gave
But you gave me your emptiness
I now take to my grave

So let this heart be still

Mama, now I'm coming home
I'm not all you wished of me
A mother's love for her son
Unspoken, help me be
I took your love for granted
And all the things you said to me
I need your arms to welcome me
But a cold stone's all I see

Let my heart go
Let your son grow
Mama, let my heart go
Or let this heart be still

Let my heart go
Mama, let my heart go
You never let my heart go
So let this heart be still

Never I ask of you
But never I gave
But you gave me your emptiness
I now take to my grave
Never I ask of you
But never I gave
But you gave me your emptiness
I now take to my grave

So let this heart be still


12. Thorn Within

Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned
Find me guilty of the life I feel within

When I'm branded,
This mark of shame
Should I look down, disgraced,
Or straight ahead and know that you must blame?

I am the secret
I am the sin
I am the guilty
And I am, I am the thorn within

Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned
Find me guilty when true guilt is from within

So point your fingers,
Point right at me
For I am shadows and will follow you.
One and the same are we

I am the secret
I am the sin
I am the guilty
And I am, I am the thorn within

I do your time, I take your fall
I'm branded guilty for us all

So point your fingers,
Point right at me
For I am shadows and will follow you.
One and the same are we

I am your secrets
I am your sin
I am your guilty
And I am, I am the thorn within

I am the thorn within
I am the thorn within


13. Ronnie

Story starts, quiet town
Small-town boy, big-time frown
Never talks, never plays
Different path, lost his way

Then streets of red... red, I'm afraid...
There's no confetti, no parade
Nothing happens in this boring place
But, oh my God, how it all did change

Now they all pray,
"Blood stain, wash away."

He said,
"Lost my way
This bloody day
Lost my way."

I heard it
He said,
"Lost my way
This bloody day
Lost my way."

Oh, please wash away
But blood stained the sun red today

I always said something's wrong
With little, strange Ronnie Long
Never laughed, never smiled
Talked alone for miles and miles and miles

"Gallows calls, son," I say
Keep your smile and laugh all day
Think once again in this boring place
For little boys, how they soon change

And they all pray,
"Blood stain, wash away."

He said,
"I lost my way
This bloody day
Lost my way."

I heard it
He said,
"I lost my way
This bloody day
I lost my way."

Oh, please wash away
But blood stained the sun red today

Well, all the green things died when Ronnie moved to this place
He said, "Don't you dare ask why I'm cursed to wear this face."
Now we all know why the children called him Ronnie Frown
When he pulled that gun from his pocket they all fall down, down, down

He said,
"Lost my way
This bloody day
Lost my way."

Yeah, yeah
I heard it
He screamed,
"Lost my way
This bloody day
Lost my way."

Oh, please wash away
But blood stained the sun red today

All things wash away
And they all fall down
But blood stained the sun today

All things wash away
And they all fall down
But blood stained the sun today


14. The Outlaw Torn

And now I wait my whole lifetime for you
And now I wait my whole lifetime for you

I ride the dirt, I ride the tide for you
I search the outside, search inside for you

To take back what you left me
I know I'll always burn to be
The one who seeks so I may find
And now I wait my whole lifetime

Outlaw of torn
Outlaw of torn
And I'm torn

So on I wait my whole lifetime for you
So on I wait my whole lifetime for you

The more I search, the more my need for you
The more I bless, the more I bleed for you

You make me smash the clock and feel
I'd rather die behind the wheel
Time was never on my side
So on I wait my whole lifetime

Outlaw of torn
Outlaw of torn
Outlaw of torn
And I'm torn

Hear me
And if I close my mind in fear
Please pry it open
See me
And if my face becomes sincere
Beware
Hold me
And when I start to come undone
Stitch me together
Save me
And when you see me strut
Remind me of what left this outlaw torn

On I burn!


2. The Memory Remains

[feat. Marianne Faithfull]

[Hetfield, Ulrich]

Fortune, fame
Mirror vain
Gone insane
But the memory remains

Heavy rings on fingers wave
Another star denies the grave
See the nowhere crowd,
Cry the nowhere tears of honor

Like twisted vines that grow
Hide and swallow mansions whole
And dim the light of an already faded prima donna

Fortune, fame
Mirror vain
Gone insane.
Fortune, fame
Mirror vain
Gone insane.
But the memory remains

Heavy rings hold cigarettes
Up to lips that time forgets
While the Hollywood sun sets behind your back

And can't the band play on?
Just listen, they play my song
Ash to ash
Dust to dust
Fade to black

Fortune, fame
Mirror vain
Gone insane (insane)
Fortune, fame
Mirror vain
Gone insane.
Dance, little tin goddess

Na-na-na

Drift away
Fade away
Little tin goddess

Ash to ash
Dust to dust
Fade to black

Fortune, fame
Mirror vain
Gone insane (insane)
Fortune, fame
Mirror vain
Gone insane.
But the memory remains

Ash to ash (ash to ash)
Dust to dust (dust to dust)
Fade to black (fade to black)
But the memory remains

Yeah
To this faded prima donna yeah,
Yeah

[Solo]

Dance, little tin goddess, dance

4. The Unforgiven II

Lay beside me, tell me what they've done
Speak the words I wanna hear, to make my demons run
The door is locked now, but it's open if you're true
If you can understand the me, than I can understand the you

Lay beside me, under wicked sky
The black of day, dark of night, we share this paralyze
The door cracks open, but there's no sun shining through
Black heart scarring darker still, but there's no sun shining through
No, there's no sun shining through
No, there's no sun shining...

What I've felt, what I've known
Turn the pages, turn the stone
Behind the door, should I open it for you....

What I've felt, what I've known
Sick and tired, I stand alone
Could you be there, 'cause I'm the one who waits for you
Or are you unforgiven too?

Come lay beside me, this won't hurt I swear
She loves me not, she loves me still, but she'll never love again
She lay beside me, but she'll be there when I'm gone
Black heart scarring darker still, yes she'll be there when I'm gone
Yes, she'll be there when I'm gone
Dead sure she'll be there...

What I've felt, what I've known
Turn the pages, turn the stone
Behind the door, should I open it for you....

What I've felt, what I've known
Sick and tired, I stand alone
Could you be there, 'cause I'm the one who waits for you
Or are you unforgiven too?

[Solo]

Lay beside me, tell me what I've done
The door is closed, so are your eyes
But now I see the sun, now I see the sun
Yes, now I see it

What I've felt, what I've known
Turn the pages, turn the stone
Behind the door, should I open it for you....

What I've felt, what I've known
So sick and tired, I stand alone
Could you be there, 'cause I'm the one who waits,
The one who waits for you....

Oh what I've felt, what I've known
Turn the pages, turn the stone
Behind the door, should I open it for you.... (So I dub thee unforgiven....)

Oh, what I've felt....
Oh, what I've known....

I take this key (never free...)
And I bury it (never me...) in you
Because you're unforgiven too....

Never free....
Never me....
'Cause you're unforgiven too....
Oh


5. Better Than You

Holding the key
Holding me back 'cause I'm striving to be

Better than you
Better than you [Jason]
Better than you
Better than you [Jason]

Lock horns, I push and I strive
Some how I feel more alive

Bury the seed
Bury me deep when there's no will to be

Better than you
Better than you [Jason]
Better than you
Better than you [Jason]

Look up to me
Look it's me, at what you hear
See right through me
See the one who can't be free
See right through me
Look it's me what no one wants to see

Hmmm, now, see the black cloud up ahead
that's me
And this poison ivy chokes the tree
Again it's me
And I'm the filthy one on Bourbon Street
You walk on by
I'm the little boy that pushes, pushes
Makes him cry

Yeah look it's me
The one who can't be free
Much too young to focus
But to old to see

Hey, hey, look it's me
What no one wants to see
See what you brought this world
Just what you want you want to see
Hey ma, hey ma look it's me

Hey ma, hey ma look it's me

11. Low Man's Lyric

My eyes seek reality
My fingers seek my veins
Theres a dog at your back step
He must come in from the rain

I fall cause I let go
The net below has rot away
So my eyes seek reality
And my fingers seek my veins

The trash fire is warm
But nowhere safe from the storm
And I can't bare to see
What I've let me be
So wicked and worn

So as I write to you
Of what is done and to do
Maybe you'll understand
And won't cry for this man
'Cause low man is due

Please forgive me

My eyes seek reality
My fingers feel for faith
Touch clean with a dirty hand
I touched the clean to the waste

The trash fire is warm
But nowhere safe from the storm
And I can't bare to see
What I've let me be
So wicked and worn

So as I write to you
Of what is done and to do
Maybe you'll understand
And won't cry for this man
'Cause low man is due

Please forgive me
Please forgive me
Please forgive me

So low the sky is all I see
All I want from you is forgive me
So you bring this poor dog in from the rain
Though he just wants right back out again

And I cry, to the alley way
Confess all to the rain
But I lie, lie straight to the mirror
The one I've broken, to match my face

The trash fire is warm
But nowhere safe from the storm
And I can't bare to see
What I've let me be
So wicked and worn

So as I write to you (yeah)
Of what is done and to do (yeah)
Maybe you'll understand
And won't cry for this man
'Cause low man is due

Please forgive me
Please forgive me

So low the sky is all I see
All I want from you is forgive me
So you bring this poor dog in from the rain
Though he just wants right back out again

My eyes seek reality
My fingers seek my veins


12. Attitude

Suppose I say
I'm never satisfied
Suppose I say
You cut some root
To make the tree survive

Just let me kill you for a while
Just let me kill you for a smile
Just let me kill you once
I'm oh so bored to death

Ohhhh, I hunger
I hunger
I eat

Born Into Attitude
Asleep at the wheel
Throw all your bullets in the fire
And run like hell
Why cure the fever?
What ever happened to sweat?

Suppose I say
the vultures smile at me
Suppose I say
I've sent them down
And they plan to pick you clean

And satifaction this way comes
And satifaction this way comes
And satifaction's here and gone, gone
Yeah gone again

Oooh, I hunger
Ooh I hunger
I eat

Born Into Attitude
Asleep at the wheel
Throw all your bullets in the fire
And stand there

Born Into Attitude
Twist mother tongue
Throw all your bullets in the fire
And run like hell
Why cure the fever?
What ever happened to sweat?

[Solo]

Just let me kill you for a while
Just let me kill you for a smile
Just let me kill you once for me
I'm bored to death

And satifaction this way comes
And satifaction this way comes
And satifaction's here and gone, gone
gone again

Yeah I hunger
Oooh I hunger

Born Into Attitude
Asleep at the wheel
Throw all your bullets in the fire
And stand there

Born Into Attitude
Twist mother tongue
Throwing all your bullets in the fire
And run like hell
Why cure the fever?
What ever happened to sweat?


13. Fixxxer

Dolls of voodoo all stuck with pins
One for each of us and our sins
So you lay us in a line
Push your pins they make us humble
Only you can tell in time
If we fall or mearly stumble

But tell me
Can you heal what father's done?
Or fix this hole in mother's son?
Can you heal the broken worlds within?
Can you strip away so we may start again?

Tell me
Can you heal what father's done?
Or cut this rope and let us run?
Just when all seems fine
And I'm pain free
You jab another pin
Jab another pin in me

Mirror, mirror upon the wall
Break the spell or become the doll
See you sharpening the pins
So the holes will remind us
We're just the toys in the hands of another
And in time, the needles turn from shine to rust

But tell me
Can you heal what father's done?
Or fix this hole in mother's son?
Can you heal the broken worlds within?
Can you strip away so we may start again?

Tell me
Can you heal what father's done?
Or cut this rope and let us run?
Just when all seems fine
And I'm pain free
You jab another pin
Jab another pin in me

Jab it
Here come the pins

Blood for face
Sweat for dirt
Three X's for the stone
To break this curse
A ritual's due
I believe I'm not alone
Shell of shotgun
Pint of gin
Numb us up to shield the pins
Renew our faith
Which way we can
To fall in love with life again
To fall in love with life again
To fall in love with life again
To fall in love
To fall in love
To fall in love with life again

So tell me
Can you heal what father's done?
Or fix this hole in mother's son?
Can you heal the broken worlds within?
Can you strip away so we may start again?

Tell me
Can you heal what father's done?
Or cut this rope and let us run?
Just when all seems fine
And I'm pain free
You jab another pin
Jab another pin in me

No more pins in me
No more, no more pins in me
No more, no more pins in me
No more, no more, no more
No, no, no

1. No Leaf Clover

And it feels right this time
On this crash course with the big time
Pay no mind to the distant thunder
New day fills his head with wonder, boy....

Says it feels right this time
Turned it 'round and found the right line
Good day to be alive Sir
Good day to be alive, he said.....

Then it comes to be that the soothing light at the end of your tunnel
Is just a freight train coming your way
Then it comes to be that the soothing light at the end of your tunnel
Is just the freight train coming your way

Don't it feel right like this
All the pieces fall to his wish
Sucker for that quick reward boy
Sucker for that quick reward they said.....

Then it comes to be that the soothing light at the end of your tunnel
Is just a freight train coming your way
Then it comes to be that the soothing light at the end of your tunnel
Is just the freight train coming your way......
It's coming your way
It's coming your way......
Here comes

1. Frantic

If I could have my wasted days back
Would I use them to get back on track?
Stop to warm at Karma's burning
Or look ahead, but keep on turning?

Do I have the strength
To know how I'll go?
Can I find it inside
To deal with what I shouldn't know?

Could I have my wasted days back
Would I use them to get back on track?

You live it or lie it!

My lifestyle determines my death style

Keep searching, Keep on searching
This search goes on, This search goes on

Frantic tick tick tick tick tick tick tock
Frantic tick tick tick tick tick tick tock

I've worn out always being afraid
An endless stream of fear that I've made
Treading water full of worry
This frantic tick tick talk of hurry

Do I have the strength
To know how I'll go?
Can I find inside
To deal with what I shouldn't know?

Worn out always being afraid
An endless stream of fear that I've made

You live it or lie it!

My lifestyle determines my death style

Keep searching, Keep on searching
This search goes on, This search goes on
Frantic tick tick tick tick tick tick tock
Frantic tick tick tick tick tick tick tock

My lifestyle (Birth Is Pain)
Determines my death style (Life Is Pain)
A rising tide (Death Is Pain)
That pushes to the other side (It's All The Same)


2. St. Anger

Saint Anger 'round my neck
Saint Anger 'round my neck
He never gets respect
Saint Anger 'round my neck

[x2]
You flush it out, You flush it out
Saint Anger 'round my neck
You flush it out, You flush it out
He never gets respect

Fuck it all and no regrets
I hit the lights on these dark sets
I need a voice to let myself
To let myself go free
Fuck it all and fuckin' no regrets
I hit the lights on these dark sets
Medallion noose, I hang myself
Saint Anger 'round my neck

I feel my world shake
Like an earth quake
Hard to see clear
Is it me? Is it fear?

I'm madly in anger with you [x4]

Saint Anger 'round my neck

Like an earth quake
Hard to see clear
Is it me? Is it fear?

I'm madly in anger with you [x4]

And I want my anger to be healthy
And I want my anger just for me
And I need my anger not to control me
And I want my anger to be me

And I need to set my anger free [x4]

Set it free!

Fuck it all and no regrets
I hit the lights on these dark sets
I need a voice to let myself
To let myself go free
Fuck it all and fuckin' no regrets
I hit the lights on these dark sets
Medallion noose, I hang myself
Saint Anger 'round my neck

I feel my world shake
Like an earth quake
Hard to see clear
Is it me? Is it fear?

I'm madly in anger with you [x4]


3. Some Kind Of Monster

These are the eyes that can't see me
These are the hands that drop your trust
These are the boot s that kick you around
This is the tongue that speaks on the inside
These are the ears that ring with hate
This is the face that I'll never change
This is the fist that grinds you down
This is the voice of silence no more

These are the legs in circles run
This is the beating you'll never know
These are the lips that taste no freedom
This is the feel that's not safe
This is the face you'll never change
This is the god that ain't so pure
This is the god that is not pure
This is the voice of silence no more

We the people
Are we the people?

Some kind of monster
The monster lives

This is the face that stones you cold
This is the moment that needs to breathe
These are the claws that scratch these wounds
This is the pain that never leaves
This is the tongue that whips you down
This is the burden of every man
These are the screams that pierce your skin
This is the voice of silence no more

This is the test of flesh and soul
This is the trap that smells so good
This is the flood that drains these eyes
These are the looks that chill to the bone
These are the fears that swing over head
These are the weights that hold you down
This is the end that will never end
This is the voice of silence no more

We the people
Are we the people?

Some kind of monster
The monster lives

This is the cloud that swallows trust
This is the black that uncolors us
This is the face that you hide from
This is the mask that comes undone
Ominous,
I'm in us


4. Dirty Window

I see my reflection in the window
It looks different, so different than what you see
Projecting Judgement on the world
This house is clean baby
This house is clean

Am I who I think I am?
Am I who I think I am?
Am I who I think I am?
Look out my window and see it's gone wrong
Court is in session and I slam my gavel down

I'm judge and I'm jury and I'm executioner too

Projector, Protector, Rejector, Infector, Projector
Infrector, Injector, Defector, Rejector

I see my reflection in the window
This window clean inside, dirty on the out
I'm looking different than me
This house is clean baby
This house is clean

Am I who I think I am?
Am I who I think I am?
Am I who I think I am?
Look out my window and see it's gone wrong
Court is in session and I slam my gavel down

I'm judge and I'm jury and I'm executioner too

Projector, Protector, Rejector, Infector, Projector
Infrector, Injector, Defector, Rejector

I drink from the cup of denial
I'm judging the world from my throne
I drink from the cup of denial
I'm judging the world from my throne


5. Invisible Kid

Invisible kid
Never see what he did
Got stuck where he hid
Fallen through the grid

Invisible kid
Got a place of his own
Where he'll never be known
Inward he's grown

Invisible kid
Locked away in his brain
From the shame and the pain
World down the drain

Invisible kid
Suspicious of your touch
Don't want no crutch
But it's all too much

I hide inside
I hurt inside
I hide inside, bull I'll show you...

I'm OK, just go away
Into distance let me fade
I'm OK, just go away
I'm OK, but please don't stray too far

Open your heart
I'm beating right here
Open your mind
I'm beating right here
Open your heart
I'm beating right here
Open your mind
I'm beating right here

Ooh, what a good boy you are
Out of the way and you're kept to yourself
Ooh, can't you see that he's not here
He doesn't want the attention you give
Ooh, unplugging from it all
Invisible kid floats alone in his room
Ooh, what a quiet boy you are
He looks so calm floating 'round and around himself


6. My World

The motherfuckers got in my head
Trying to make me someone else instead

It's my world now

Mama, why's it rainin' in my room
Cheer up boy clouds will move on soon
Heavy fog got me lost inside
Gonna sit right back and enjoy this ride

It's my world now
You can't have it
It's my world, It's my world
It's my world

I'm out of my head, out of my head
Get 'em out of my head, out of my head
Get 'em out

Who's in charge of my head today
Dancin' devils in angels way

It's my time now

Look out motherfuckers here I come
Gonna make my head home
The sons of bitches tried to take my head
Tried to make me someone else instead

It's my world now
You can't have it
It's my world, It's my world
It's my world

I'm out of my head, out of my head
Get 'em out of my head, out of my head
Get 'em out

Not only do I not know the answer
I don't even know what the question is

God it feels like it only rains on me

Not only do I not know the answer
I don't even know what the question is

I'm out of my head, out of my head
Get 'em out of my head, out of my head
Get 'em out

Enough's enough


7. Shoot Me Again

I won't go away
Right here I'll stay

Stand silent in flames
Stand tall 'till it fades

Shoot me again
I ain't dead yet

Shoot me again

All these shots I take
I spit back at you
All the shit you fake
Comes back to haunt you

All the shots

All the shots I take
What difference did I make?
All the shots I take
I spit back at you

I won't go away, with a bullet in my back
Right here I'll stay, with a bullet in my back

Shoot me take a shot

I'll stand on my own, with a bullet in my back
I'm stranded and sold, with a bullet in my back

I bite my tongue
Trying not to shoot back
No compromise
My heart won't pump the other way

Wake the sleeping giant
Wake the beast
Wake the sleeping dog
No, Let him sleep


8. Sweet Amber

[x2]
Wash your back so you won't stab mine
Get in bed with your own kind
Live your life so you don't see mine
Drape your back so you won't shine

[x2]
Oh then she holds my hand
And I lie to get a smile

[x4]
Using what I want
To get what you want

Oh Sweet Amber
How sweet are you?
How sweet does it get?
How sweet are you?
How sweet does it get?

[x2]
Chase the rabbit, fetch the stick
She rolls me over 'til I'm sick
She deals in habits, deals in pain
I run away but I'm back again

Oh then she holds my hand
And I lie to get a smile
And she squeezes tighter
I still lie to get a smile

[x4]
Using what I want
To get what you want

Oh Sweet Amber
How sweet are you?
How sweet does it get?
How sweet are you?
How sweet does it get?

[x2]
She holds the pen that spells the end
She traces me and draws me in

Ooh Sweet Amber
Ooh Sweet Amber

How sweet are you?
How sweet does it get?
How sweet are you?
How sweet does it get?

(It's never as sweet as it seems)


9. Unnamed Feeling

Been here before
Been here before couldn't say I liked it
Do I start writing this down?
Just let me plug you into my world
Can't you help me be uncrazy?

Name this for me, heat the cold air
Take the chill off of my life
And if I could I'd turn my eyes
To look inside and see what's comin'

It comes alive, It comes alive, It comes alive
And I die a little more
It comes alive, It comes alive, It comes alive
Each moment here I die a little more

Then the unnamed feeling
It comes alive
The the unnamed feeling
Takes me away

I'm frantic in your soothing arms
I can not sleep in this down filled world
I've found safety in this loneliness
But I can not stand it anymore

Cross my heart hope not to die
Swallow evil, ride the sky
Lose myself in a crowded room
You fool, you fool, it will be here soon

It comes alive, It comes alive, It comes alive
And I die a little more
It comes alive, It comes alive, It comes A-live
Each moment And I die a little more

Then the unnamed feeling
It comes alive
The the unnamed feeling
Treats me this way
And I wait for this train
Toes over the line
And then the unnamed feeling
Takes me away

Get the fuck out of here
I just wanna get the fuck away from Me
I rage, I glaze, I hurt, I hate
I hate it all, why? Why? Why me?

I cannot sleep with a head like this
I wanna cry, I wanna scream
I rage, I glaze, I hurt, I hate
I wanna hate it all away


10. Purify

Tear it down
Strip the layers off
My turpentine
Old paint, old looks
Cover up the past
White heat, white light
Super white bones
Bones of you and I

Pure if I... can't you help me?
Pure if I... won't you help me?
Purify you and I
Purify you and I
Pure if I... can't you help me?
Pure if I... won't you help me?
Purify you and I
Purify you and I

Truth and dare
Peeling back the skin
Acid wash
Ghost white
Ultra clean
Wanna be skeleton
Clear eyes
Diamond eyes
Strip the past of mine
My sweet turpentine

I can find the dirt on anything
I can find the dirt on anything

I ain't dancing with your skeletons
I ain't dancing with what might have been


11. All Within My Hands

All within my hands
Squeeze it in, crush it down
All within my hands
Hold it dear, hold it suffocate

All within my hands
Love to death, smack you 'round and 'round and
All within my hands
Beware

Love is control
I'll die if I let go

Hate me now
Kill all within my hands
Hate me now
Crush all within my hands
Squeeze all within my hands
Choke all within my hands
Hate me now
Trap all within my hands
Hurry up and hate me now
Kill all within my hands

All within my hands
Take your fear, pump me up
All within my hands
Let you run, then I pull your leash

All within my hands
Under thumb, under to myself
All within my hands
Beware

Hate me now
Kill all within my hands
Hate me now
Crush all within my hands
Squeeze all within my hands
Choke all within my hands
Hate me now
Trap all within my hands
Hurry up and hate me now
Kill all within my hands again

I'll die if I let go
Control is love, love is control
I'll die if I let go
Control is love, love is control

I will only let you breath
My air that you receive
Then we'll see if I let you love me
Kill Kill Kill Kill Kill

1. That Was Just Your Life

Like a siren in my head that always threatens to repeat,
Like a blind man that is strapped into the speeding driver's seat,
Like a face that learns to speak, when all it knew was how to bite
Like a misery that keeps me focused though I've gone astray
Like an endless nightmare that I must awaken from each day.

Like conviction
A premonition,
Not worthy of, so I deny... I deny.

[Pre-chorus:]
I blind my eyes and try to force it all into place,
I stitch them up, see not my fall from grace.
I blind my eyes, I hide and feel it passing me by,
I open just in time to say goodbye.

[Chorus:]
Almost like your life,
Almost like your endless fight,
Curse the day is long,
Realize you don't belong,
Disconnect somehow,
Never stop the bleeding now,
Almost like your fight,
And there it went,
Almost like your life.

Like a wound that keeps on bleeding to remind me not to think
Like a raging river drowning when I only need a drink,
Like a poison that I swallow, but I want the world to die.
Like a release from a prison that I didn't know I was in,
Like a fight to live the past I prayed to leave from way back then
Like a general without a mission until the war will start again,
Start again.

[Pre-chorus]
[Chorus]

[Solo]

Like a touch from hell to feel how hot
That it can get if you get caught,
Like a strike from heaven turns that key,
And brings you straight down to your knees,
Like a touch from hell to feel how hot
That it can get if I get caught,
Like a strike from heaven to reprieve,
That brings you straight down to your knees.

[Dual guitar solo]

[Chorus]

That was just your life.


2. The End Of The Line

Need more and more
Tainted misery
Bleed, battle scars
Chemical affinity
Reign, legacy
Innocence corrode
Stain, rot away
Catatonic overload

Choke, asphyxia
Snuff reality
Scorch, kill the light
Incinerate celebrity
Reaper, butchery
Karma amputee
Bloodline redefined
Death, contagious deity

[Pre-chorus:]
Hooked into this deceiver
Need more and more
Into the endless fever
Need more and more

[Chorus:]
New consequence machine
You burn through all your gasoline
Asylum overtime, never mind
You've reached the end of the line

Time, choke the clock
Steal another day
Die faithfully
Narcissistic fade away
Twisted, jumped the rail
Shatter the crowd below
Breaker, chase the ghost
From latest high to all-time low

[Pre-chorus]
[Chorus]

Drop the hourglass of time
Spilling sand we will not find
As we gather here today
We bid farewell
The slave becomes the master
The slave becomes the master
The slave becomes the master

Need more and more
Right now and ever after
Need more and more

New consequence machine
You burn into through all your gasoline
Asylum overtime, never mind
Dead hourglass of time
Sand we will not ever find
We gather here today to say goodbye
'Cause you've reached the end of the line
The end of the line
The end of the line
The end of the line
You've reached the end of the line


3. Broken, Beat & Scarred

You rise, you fall, you're down then you rise again
What don't kill you makes you more strong
You rise, you fall, you're down then you rise again
What don't kill you makes you more strong

Rise, fall, down, rise again
What don't kill you makes you more strong
Rise, fall, down, rise again
What don't kill you makes you more strong

Through black days
Through black nights
Through pitch black insights

[Chorus:]
Breaking your teeth on the hard life coming
Show your scars
Cutting your feet on the hard earth running
Show your scars
Breaking your life, broken beat and scarred
But we die hard

The dawn, the death, the fight to the final breath
What don't kill you makes you more strong
The dawn, the death, the fight to the final breath
What don't kill you makes you more strong

Dawn, death, fight, final breath
What don't kill you makes you more strong
Dawn, death, fight, final breath
What don't kill you makes you more strong

They scratch me
They scrape me
They cut and rape me

[Chorus]

Breaking your teeth on the hard life coming
Show your scars
Cutting your feet on the hard earth running
Show your scars
Bleeding your soul in a hard luck story
Show your scars
Spilling your blood in the hot sun's glory
Show your scars
Breaking your life, broken, beat and scarred
We die hard


4. The Day That Never Comes

Born to push you around
Better just stay down
You pull away,
He hits the flesh,
You hit the ground

Mouth's so full of lies
Tend to black your eyes
Just keep them closed,
Keep praying,
Just keep waiting

[Chorus:]
Waiting for the one
The day that never comes
When you stand up and feel the warmth
But the sunshine never comes, no…
No, the sunshine never comes

Push you ‘cross that line
Just stay down this time
Hide in yourself,
Crawl in yourself,
You'll have your time

God, I'll make them pay
Take it back one day
I'll end this day,
I'll splatter color on this grey

[Chorus:]
Waiting for the one
The day that never comes
When you stand up and feel the warmth
But the sunshine never comes.

"Love" is a four letter word
And never spoken here
"Love" is a four letter word
Here in this prison

I suffer this no longer
I put an end to...
This I swear!
This I swear!
The sun will shine
This I swear!
This I swear!
This I swear!

[Solo]


5. All Nightmare Long

One, two

Luck. Runs. Out.

Crawl from the wreckage one more time
Horrific memory twists the mind
Dark, rugged, cold and hard to turn
Path of destruction, feel it burn

Still life, incarnation
Still life, infamy
Hallucination
Heresy
Still you run, what's to come?
What's to be?

[Chorus:]
'cause we hunt you down without mercy
Hunt you down all nightmare long
Feel us breathe upon your face
Feel us shift, every move we trace
Hunt you down without mercy
Hunt you down all nightmare long, yeah
Luck runs out
You crawl back in
But your luck runs out

One, two

Luck. Runs. Out.

The light that is not light is here
To flush you out with your own fear
You hide, you hide, but will be found
Release your grip without a sound

Still life, immolation
Still life, infamy
Hallucination
Heresy
Still you run, what's to come?
What's to be?

[Chorus]

One, two, three, four

Then you crawl back in
Into your obsession
Never to return
This is your confession

Hunt you down without mercy
Hunt you down all nightmare long
Feel us breathe upon your face
Feel us shift, every move we trace
Hunt you down without mercy
Hunt you down all nightmare long, yeah
Luck runs out
You crawl back in
But your luck runs out

Your luck runs out


6. Cyanide

Sleep and dream of this
Death angel's kiss
Brings final bliss
Completely

[Chorus:]
Empty they say
Death, won't you let me stay?
Empty they say
Death, hear me call your name
Call your name!
Suicide, I've already died
You're just the funeral I've been waiting for
Cyanide, living dead inside
Break this empty shell forevermore

Wait, wait patiently
Your death-black wings
Unfolding sleep
Spreading over me

[Chorus]

Say, is that rain or are they tears?
That has stained your concrete face for years
The crying, weeping, shedding strife
Year after year, life after life

An air of freshly broken ground
A concrete angel laid right down
Upon the grave which swallows fast
It's peace at last, oh, peace at last

[Chorus]

Forevermore!
Forevermore!
It's just the funeral I've been waiting for!


7. The Unforgiven III

How could he know this new dawn's light
Would change his life forever?
Set sail to sea but pulled off course
By the light of golden treasure

Was he the one causing pain
With his careless dreaming?
Been afraid, always afraid
Of the things he's feeling
He could just be gone
He would just sail on
He'll just sail on

[Chorus:]
How can I be lost
If I've got nowhere to go?
Searched for seas of gold
How come it's got so cold?
How can I be lost?
In remembrance I relive
How can I blame you
When it's me I can't forgive?

These days drift on inside a fog
It's thick and suffocating
This sinking life outside its hell
Inside intoxicating
He's run aground like his life
Water's much too shallow
Slipping fast down with the ship
Fading in the shadows now

Now a castaway
They've all gone away.
They've gone away.

[Chorus]

Forgive me, forgive me not
Forgive me, forgive me not
Forgive me, forgive me not
Forgive me, forgive me,
Why can't I forgive me?

Set sail to sea but pulled off course
By the light of golden treasure
How could he know this new dawn's light
Would change his life forever?

[Chorus]


8. The Judas Kiss

When the world has turned its back
When the days have turned pitch black
When the fear abducts your tongue
When the fire's dead and gone

So what now?
Where go I?
When you think it's all said and done...

When you are the ostracized
Selfish written, dead goodbyes
Twisting on the tourniquet
When the pieces never fit

So what now?
Where go I?
When you think it's all said and done...

[Chorus:]
Bow down,
Sell your soul to me
I will set you free
Pacify your demons
Bow down
Surrender unto me
Submit infectiously
Sanctify your demons
Into abyss
You don't exist
Cannot resist the Judas kiss

When the storm has blacked your sky
Intuition crucify
When the ego strips your reign
Assassinate the living flame

So what now?
Where go I?
When you think it's all said and done

Venom of a life insane
Flies into your fragile vein
Internalize and decimate
Patronize and complicate

So what now?
Where go I?
When you think it's all said and done

[Chorus]

Judas lives, recite this vow
I've become your new god now

Followed you from dawn of time
Whispered thoughts into your mind
Watched your towers hit the ground
Lured the children never found
Helped your kings abuse their crown

In the heart of feeble man
Plant the seeds of my own plan
The strong and powerful will fall
Find a piece of me in all
Inside you all so...

[Chorus]


9. Suicide & Redemption

[Instrumental]


10. My Apocalypse

Claustrophobic
Crawl out of this skin
Heart explosive
Reaching, pull that pin

Feel thy name extermination
Desecrate inhale the fire

So we cross that line
Into the grips
Total eclipse
Suffer unto my apocalypse!

Deadly vision
Prophecy reveal
Death magnetic
Pulling closer still

Feel thy name annihilation
Desolate, inhale the fire

So we cross that line
Into the grips
Total eclipse
Suffer unto my apocalypse!

My apocalypse... Go!

Crushing metal, ripping skin
Tossing body mannequin
Spilling blood, bleeding gas

Mangle flesh, snapping spine
Dripping bloody valentine
Shatter face, spitting glass

Split apart
Split apart
Split apart
Split
Spit it out!

What makes me drift a little bit closer?
Dead man takes the steering wheel
What makes me know it's time to cross over?
Forced to repeat until I feel

See through the skin the bones they all rattle
Future and past they disagree
Flesh falls away the bones they all shatter
I start to see the end in me

See the end in me...

Claustrophobic
Climb out of this skin
Heart explosive
Waiting for that pin

Violate, annihilate
A loser to my eyes
Obliterate, exterminate
At last accept, deny

Feel thy name as hell awakens
Destiny, inhale the fire

But we cross that line
Into the grips
Total eclipse
Suffer unto my apocalypse!

Tyrants awaken my apocalypse!
Demon awaken my apocalypse!
Heaven awaken my apocalypse!
Suffer forever my apocalypse!

1. Hate Train

Hate is a train
That thunders aimless through my head
And hate is the fame
Chained to the wheel until I'm dead

Rage is a flame
Creates a touch to boil the seas
And rage is to blame
Forever sorry I shall be

And from a darkness I descend
Clenching a torch of sweet revenge

You took away tomorrow, still I stand
I ride into the sorrow, still I stand
You took away tomorrow, still I stand
Straight down into the sorrow, but still I stand

Wrath is the name
Branding suffer onto you
And wrath takes the shame
And holds me down until its through

And from a darkness I descend
Clenching a torch of sweet revenge

You took away tomorrow, still I stand
I ride into the sorrow, still I stand
You took away tomorrow, still I stand
I sink into the sorrow, but still I stand

And hate is a train
A beast awakened by your call
And hate is a train
A beast that never slows at all

And from a darkness I descend
Clenching a torch of sweet revenge
Burst into flame, the bitter end
And shake the gates of hell again

Cursed to drown in sorrow...

You took away tomorrow, still I stand
I ride into the sorrow, still I stand
You took away tomorrow, still I stand
You left me here with sorrow, still I stand


2. Just A Bullet Away

All roads they lead to shame
All drowning in the blame
All reflections look the same
In the shine of the midnight revolver

All hide beneath a skin
A hope so paper thin
I'm at the door again
And the shine of the midnight revolver

Even the promise of danger has gone dull
Staring down the barrel of a 45

Suck on the barrel
Suck on the barrel
Suck it 'til it's gone dry

For all reflections look the same
In the shine of the midnight revolver

Redemption purify
Will nothing satisfy
The scars just multiply
In the shine of the midnight revolver

Twisting in apocalypse
Death upon the fingertips
Frigid metal touches lips
And the shine of the midnight revolver

'Cause you lied

Just a bullet away
Just a bullet away from leavin' you
Just a bullet away
Stop the voices in my head

Caressing death again
Becomes the heroin
Forbidden medicine
Puts a shine on the midnight revolver

Eternal borderline
All the faces intertwine
Oh God... now I see mine
In the shine of the midnight revolver

Even the promise of danger has gone dull
Staring down the barrel of a 45

Suck on the barrel
Suck on the barrel
Suck... suck till it's dry

For all reflections look the same
In the shine of the midnight revolver

Down In Misery
Down In Misery

Just a bullet away
Just a bullet away from leavin' you
Just a bullet away
Stop the voices in my head

All roads they lead to shame
All drowning in the blame
Reflections look the same
In the shine of the midnight revolver

All hide beneath a skin
A hope so paper thin
I'm at the door again
And the shine of the midnight revolver

Even the promise of danger has gone dull
Staring down the barrel of a 45

Suck on the barrel
Suck on the barrel
Suck... suck till it's dry

Do all reflections look the same
In the shine of the midnight revolver

'Cause you lied
Yes you lied

Just a bullet away
Just a bullet away from leavin' you
Just a bullet away
Stop the voices in my head


3. Hell And Back

There is nowhere else I can run to
She is wretched but she comforts me

After everyone goes home
She's always there for me

And when the sun goes hellbound
And the moon does resurrect the night
I'll hide within her
Not much good has come out the light

After everyone goes home
And I'm left here on my own
I will run straight to Hell and back

Straight to Hell and back

When they turn out all their lights
And I'm left to brood at night
Always return to Hell and back

Straight to Hell and back
Straight down yeah

A lonely light in a window
Just longing for some company

Tragic, heartless and hateful
But there's nothing as willing as she

And when the night has fallen
It falls hard and then it all begins

When she starts her calling
I feel my darkness growing from within

After everyone goes home
And I'm left here on my own
I will run straight to Hell and back

Straight to Hell and back

When they turn out all their lights
And I'm left to brood at night
Always return to Hell and back

Straight to Hell and back
Straight to Hell and back
I will run straight to Hell and back

I become two
We become one
Unbridled... unequaled... unholy... undone

The path is cut deep
The path is worn well
I'll follow my footsteps to the warmth of Hell

The warmth of Hell

After everyone goes home
And I'm left here on my own
I will run straight to Hell and back

Straight to Hell and back
Straight to Hell and back

When they turn out all their lights
And I'm left to brood at night
Always return to Hell and back

Return to Hell and back
Straight to Hell and back
Straight to Hell and back
I will run straight to Hell and back

Straight down


4. Rebel Of Babylon

Rebel grip your bottle tight
Just float away
Rebel is it hard to leave
What makes you stay?

Go take your poison ink
Sign life away
Then take your dirty spoon
And dig your grave
Dig your grave

Rebel grips the bottle tight

Rebel finds it hard to leave
What makes you stay?

He takes the poison ink
Signing life away
Then takes the dirty spoon
And digs his grave

To pierce the skin

After he's gone

1. Hardwired

In the name of desperation
In the name of wretched pain
In the name of all creation
Gone insane

We're so fucked
Shit outta luck
Hardwired to self-destruct

On the way to paranoia
On the crooked borderline
On the way to great destroyer
Doom design

We're so fucked
Shit outta luck
Hardwired to self-destruct

Once upon a planet burning
Once upon a flame
Once upon a fear returning
All in vain

Do you feel that hope is fading?
Do you comprehend?
Do you feel it terminating?
In the end

We're so fucked
Shit outta luck
Hardwired to self-destruct
Hardwired to self-destruct

Self-destruct
Self-destruct
Self-destruct


2. Atlas, Rise!

Bitterness and burden
Curses rest on thee
Solitaire and sorrow
All Eternity

Save the Earth and claim perfection
Deem the mass and blame rejection
Hold the pose, reign perception
Grudges break your back

All you bear
All you carry
All you bear
Place it right on, right on me

Die as you suffer in vain
Own all the grief and the pain
Die as you hold up the skies
Atlas, Rise!

How does it feel on your own?
Bound by the world all alone
Crushed under heavy skies
Atlas, Rise!

Crucify and witness
Circling the sun
Bastardize and ruin
What have you become?

Blame the world, and blame your maker
Wish ‘em to the undertaker
Crown yourself the other savior
So you carry on

All you bear
All you carry
All you bear
Place it right on, right on me

Die as you suffer in vain
Own all the grief and the pain
Die as you hold up the skies
Atlas, Rise!

How does it feel on your own?
Bound by the world all alone
Crushed under heavy skies
Crushed under heavy skies
Atlas, Rise!

Masquerade as maker
Heavy is the crown
Beaten down and broken
Drama wears you down

Overload, the martyr stumbles
Hit the ground and heaven crumbles
All alone, the fear shall humble
Swallow all your pride

All you bear
All you carry
All you bear
Place it right on, right on me

Die as you suffer in vain
Own all the grief and the pain
Die as you hold up the skies
Atlas, Rise!

How does it feel on your own?
Bound by the world all alone
Crushed under heavy skies
Crushed under heavy skies
Atlas, Rise!


3. Now That We're Dead

When darkness falls
May it be
That we should see the light

When reaper calls
May it be
That we walk straight and right

When doubt returns
May it be
That faith shall permeate our scars

When we're seduced
Then may it be
That we not deviate our cause

All sinners, a future
All saints, a past
Beginning, the ending
Return to ash

Now that we're dead, my dear
We can be together
Now that we're dead, my dear
We can live forever

When all is pain
May it be
It's all we've ever known

When flame consumes
May it be
It warms our dying bones

When loss has won
May it be
It's you I'm madly fighting for

When Kingdom comes
May it be
We walk right through that open door

All sinners, a future
All saints, a past
Beginning, the ending
Return to ash

Now that we're dead, my dear
We can be together
Now that we're dead, my dear
We can live forever

All sinners, a future
All saints, a past
Beginning, the ending
Return to ash

Now that we're dead, my dear
We can be together
Now that we're dead, my dear
We can live, we can live forever

Return to ashes, shed this skin
Beyond the black, we rise again
We shall live forever


4. Moth Into Flame

Blacked out
Pop queen, amphetamine
The screams crashed into silence

Tapped out
Doused in the gasoline
The high times going timeless

Decadence
Death of the innocence
The pathway starts to spiral

Infamy
All for publicity
Destruction going viral

Light it up
Ah, light it up
Another hit erases all the pain
Bulletproof
Ah, kill the truth
You're falling, but you think you're flying high
High again

Sold your soul
Built a higher wall
Yesterday
Now you're thrown away

Same rise and fall
Who cares at all?
Seduced by fame
A moth into the flame

Twisted
Backstabbing wicked
The delusion absolution

Perjurer
Fame is the murderer
Seduce you into ruin

Light it up
Ah, light it up
Another hit erases all the pain
Bulletproof
Ah, tell the truth
You're falling, but you think you're flying high
High again

Sold your soul
Built the higher wall
Yesterday
Now you're thrown away

Same rise and fall
Who cares at all?
Seduced by fame
A moth into the flame
Burn

Guarantee your name, you go and kill yourself
The vultures feast around you still
Overdose on shame and insecurity
If one won't do that fistful will

Death scene
Black hearse the limousine
A grave filled with seduction

Vaccine
Fame does the murdering
She builds up for destruction

So light it up
Ah, light it up
Another hit erases all the pain
Bulletproof
Ah, no excuse
You're falling, but you think you're flying high
High again

Sold your soul
Built the higher wall
Yesterday
Now you're thrown away

Same rise and fall
Who cares at all?
Seduced by fame
A moth into the flame

Addicted to the
Fame


5. Dream No More

He sleeps under black seas waiting
Lies dreaming in death
He sleeps under cosmos shaking
Stars granting his breath

He wakes as the world dies screaming
All horrors arrive
He wakes giving earth its bleeding
Pure madness alive

And He haunts you
And He binds your soul
And He loathes you
And reclaims it all

You turn to stone
Can't look away
You turn to stone
Madness, they say

Cthulhu, awaken

He sways in abyss returning
Inhaling black skies
He shakes with a torture burning
All lost in his eyes

And He haunts you
And He binds your soul
And He loathes you
And reclaims it all

You turn to stone
Can't look away
You turn to stone
Madness, they say

Cthulhu, awaken

You turn to stone
Can't look away
You turn to stone
Madness, they say

Sanity taken
Seething damnation
Cthulhu, awaken
(Wake) Winged salvation
Death by creation
Cthulhu, awaken
(Wake) Dreaming no more

Cthulhu, awaken
(Wake) Dreaming no more
Cthulhu, awaken
(Wake) Dreaming no more


6. Halo On Fire

Obey
Obey
Come won't you stay
Sincere
Sincere
All ends in tears
Endure
Endure
Thoughts most impure
Concede
Concede
But both shall we bleed

Oh, Halo on fire
The midnight knows it well
Fast, is desire
Creates another hell
I fear to turn on the light
For the darkness won't go away
Fast, is desire
Turn out the light
Halo on fire

Allure
Allure
Sweetness obscure
Abide
Abide
Secrets inside
Deprive
Deprive
To feel so alive
Obey
Obey
Just don't turn away

Oh, Halo on fire
The midnight knows it well
Fast, is desire
Creates another hell
I fear to turn on the light
For the darkness won't go away
Fast, is desire
Turn out the light
Halo on fire

Prayers cannot get through
Return to sender
Unto which of you
Shall I surrender
Twisting in disguise
Dark resurrection
Lighting up the skies
Wicked perfection

Too dark to sleep
Can't slip away
Open or close
My eyes betray
Beyond the black
Come won't you stay

Hello darkness
Say goodbye
Hello darkness
Say goodbye
Hello darkness
Say goodbye


7. Confusion

Wake to face the day
Grab this life and walk away
War is never done
Rub the patch and battle on
Make it go away
Please make it go away

Confusion
All sanity is now beyond me
Delusion
All sanity is but a memory
My life…
The war that never ends

Leave the battlefield
Yet its horrors never heal
Coming home from war
Pieces don't fit anymore
Make it go away
Please make it go away

Confusion
All sanity is now beyond me
Delusion
All sanity is but a memory
My life…
The war that never ends

Father please come home
Shell shocked all I've known
Father please come home

Label him a deadwood soldier now
Cast away and left to roam
Rapid is the road to sacrifice
Just takes longer to come home

Confusion
All sanity is now beyond me
Delusion
Crossfire ricochets inside me
Trapped in a memory forever
My life…
The war that never ends


8. ManUNkind

Chaos,
Awaiting for Adams return
Madness,
Smiling as we watch it burn

I've become

Hostage to my mind
Left myself behind
Blind lead blind
Quest to find
Faith in man(un)kind

Garden,
Of Eden, so simple and pure
Greedy,
Needy, must we have more

I've become

Hostage to my mind
Left myself behind
Blind lead blind
Quest to find
Faith in man(un)kind

Fascinate
Partner of insanity
Decimate
Lessons we never learn

Dominate
Killing of the innocence
Deviate
And to dust you return
Yeah

Seized by the day
Frozen captive by the night
Seized by the day
All the dark days of your life

Seized by the day
Frozen captive by the night
Led so astray
All the dark days of your life

Zero,
Reset, creation of man
Foolish,
Ready, to witness again?

I've become

Hostage to my mind
Left myself behind
Blind lead blind
Quest to find
Faith in man(un)kind

Faith in man(un)kind
Oh, faith in man(un)kind
Faith in man(un)kind
Oh, faith in man(un)kind


9. Here Comes Revenge

Little grave I'm grieving, I will mend you
Sweet revenge I'm dreaming, I will end you

I've been here since dawn of time
Countless hatreds built my shrine
I was born in anger's flame
He was Abel, I was Cain
I am here
I'm hell unbound
Burn your kingdom to the ground
To the ground

Here comes revenge, just for you
Revenge, you can't undo
Revenge, is killing me
Revenge, set me free
Eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth
A life for a life, it's my burden of proof
Revenge, just for you
Revenge
You ask forgiveness, I give you sweet revenge

I return this nightmare, I will find you
Sleepless, cloaked in despair, I'm behind you

Man has made me oh so strong
Blurring lines of right and wrong
Far too late for frail amends
Now it's come to sweet revenge
Desperate hands
That lose control
Have no mercy on your soul
On your soul

Here comes revenge, just for you
Revenge, you can't undo
Revenge, is killing me
Revenge, just set me free
Eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth
A life for a life, it's my burden of proof
Revenge, just for you
Revenge
You ask forgiveness, I give you sweet revenge

Here comes revenge, just for you
Revenge, you can't undo
Revenge, is killing me
Revenge, set me free
Eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth
A life for a life, it's my burden of proof
Revenge, just for you
Revenge
You ask forgiveness, I give you sweet revenge

Sweet revenge


10. Am I Savage?

Ooooh,
Run away, the past will bite again
Ooooh,
No matter where you dwell
You,
Here again, a captive of the howl
You,
Welcome back to hell

Faithful, as the full moon is rising
Beauty and the Beast are colliding

Sharpened edge touch liquid flame
Deepened seed soaks angers reign
Arching back, shape-shift derange
Father, how I watched you change

Am I savage?
Scratching at the door
Am I savage?
I don't recognize you anymore

Ooooh,
Tooth is fang, twisting under skin
Ooooh,
Foul tongue, black breath
Change,
Snap inside, the Beast about complete
Change,
Soon infects the rest

Faithful, as the full moon is rising
Beauty and the Beast are colliding

Sharpened edge touch liquid flame
Deepened seed soaks angers reign
Arching back, shape-shift derange
Father, how I watched you change

Am I savage?
Howling at the door
Am I savage?
I don't recognize you anymore
Anymore


Ooooh,
Inheritance, the past has bit again
Ooooh,
The next heir of anarchy
Feel,
Stretching skin so far beyond belief
I feel,
The ever changing, you, in me

Am I savage?
Scratching at the door
Am I savage?
Howling evermore
Am I savage?
I don't recognize me anymore
Anymore

Anymore, ha ha ha
Am I savage?


11. Murder One

One crown
Shines on through the sound
One crown
Born to lose
One man
Does not give a damn
One man
No excuse

Aces wild
Aces high
All the aces
Aces 'til you die

Been living to win
Been living to win


12. Spit Out the Bone

Come unto me and you will feel perfection
Come unto me and dedicate
Come unto me, you'll never feel rejection
Come unto me and terminate
Remove your heart, it's only good for bleeding
Bleeding through your fragile skin
Remove your thought cause it's only for deceiving
Deceiving thoughts destroy within

Spit out the bone

The flesh betrays the flesh
Your man has had his time
We lay him down to rest
Machined the new divine

Stop breathing
And dedicate to me
Stop dreaming
And terminate for me
All meaning
You dedicate to me
All feelings
You terminate for me

Disappear like man was never here

Long live machine
Our future supreme
Your man overthrown
Spit out the bone, yeah

Pale riders into the night
Galloping harder and faster

Through your dreaming wake
Walk towards the fire innate
Frost bitten soul below zero

Recall the shaking of the ground

Pounding, pounding

So celebrate and let your fires burn

The lords of summer have returned

2. Shadows Follow

Hanging by a thread as I play dead
Hanging by a thread and my mind is code red
Cut and run, try to hide, get away
Shut my eyes, just to hide from the fate
Cut and run, try to hide, get away
Cover up, get shelter from the hate

Demonized, liquified, tranquilized
Prophesied, just to hide from life
Night and day, led astray, in decay
Come what may, not to face that fight

Seething
Breathing
Nightmares grow
On I run
Still my shadows follow

Never can I stop 'cause they hunt me
Never can I stop 'cause the beast is hungry
Like a wolf on the hunt stalking prey
Closing in, no, it won't let me be
Like a wolf on the hunt stalks a prey
Any cost, fulfill a destiny

Seething
Fast breathing
Nightmares grow
On I run
Still my shadows follow
On I run
But still my shadows follow

Cut and run, hide away from fate
Cover up, try to hide the hate
Like a wolf, it won't let me be
Closing in, wish away, shut my eyes

Wish it away

Seething
Fast breathing
Nightmares grow
On I run
Still my shadows follow

Facing
My demons
Now I know
If I run
Still my shadows follow

I say "No!"
Still my shadows follow


3. Screaming Suicide

Welcome to this life
Born into the fight
Here to claim your dream
Look you in the eye
Patch the broken sky
Craving dopamine
Then my voice appears
Teaching you of fears
Are you good enough?
You don't recognize
Head is full of lies
You should just give up

Listen well, better listen well
Listen well, better listen well

Don't ever speak my name
Remember you're to blame
Keep me inside
Keep me inside
My name is suicide

Curse another day
Spirit locked away
Punish and deprive
Hate to be awake
Living a mistake
More dead than alive
Then a voice appears
Whisper in your ears
"You are good enough"
Throwing down a rope
A lifeline of hope
Never give you up

Listen well, better listen well
Listen well, better listen well

Don't ever speak my name
Remember you're to blame
Keep me inside
Keep me inside
My name is suicide

Terrified in sleepless nights
Caught in spotlight dead to rights
Isolate and fight your mind
Telling you you're left behind

My lying voice inside
Keeps drinking cyanide
And no more can you run
Into the sun

Terrified, sleepless nights
Caught in spotlight dead to rights
Isolate and fight your mind
Telling you you're left behind

And now you speak my name
You've given back the blame
Keep me deep inside
Don't you keep me inside
Screaming suicide

Now that I'm exposed inside
Shined a light on cyanide
I'm no longer needed here
Now you've faced your biggest fear


4. Sleepwalk My Life Away

Take a deep, waking breath
Hope the blood arrives
Burn my eyes with the sun
And pretend I'm alive
It never will appear
Strong as past desire
Light warming disappears
Like a cold, dead fire

Should I fall, I fall down
Would you come, you come 'round

Wake me
Caught in the spell I'm dreaming
Wake me
Day after day repeating
Wake me
Sleepwalk my life away

Stagger on through the fog
In the midnight sun
Shouting out at the shapes
Of the nameless no ones
All isn't what it seems
Cannot comprehend it
Captive inside a dream
Where the dawn won't end it

Should I fall, I fall down
Would you come, you come 'round

Wake me
Caught in the spell I'm dreaming
Wake me
Day after day repeating
Wake me
Sleepwalk my life away

Should I fall, I fall down
Would you come, you come 'round

Wake me
Caught in the spell I'm dreaming
Wake me
Day after day repeating
Wake me
Sleepwalk my life away


5. You Must Burn!

Catch a fire and burn all the misery
Foul fingers spin mob mentality
Anger on the rise as the flames grow higher
Choke on the smoke of the funeral pyre
Backfire

Killing all we've learned
History will burn
Burn it

Smile as it burns to the ground
The perfect don't want you around
Question yourself, you may learn
Who's the next witch you must burn?
You must burn!

In the name of hell, henchmen to conspire
Black figures loom as a dark desire
Inquisition served, build your enemy
Tied to the stake, torching heresy
Flame out

Killing all we've learned
History will burn
Burn it

Smile as it burns to the ground
The perfect don't want you around
Question yourself, you may learn
You are the witch you must burn
You must burn!

In the heat of the night
In the moon's shining light
Feed the appetite
In the heat of the night
In the moon's shining light
Feed the appetite

Smile as it burns to the ground
The perfect don't want you around
Question yourself, you may learn
You are the witch you must burn
You must burn!

You must burn!
You must burn!
You must burn!


6. Lux Æterna

Anticipation
In domination
A sea of hearts beat as one, unified
Magnification
All generations
Approaching thunder awaiting the light

Full speed or nothing
Full speed or nothing

Lux Æterna
Lux Æterna

Exhilaration
Frenzied sensation
Kindred alliance connected inside
Commiseration
Sonic salvation
Cast out the demons that strangle your life

Full speed or nothing
Full speed or nothing

Lux Æterna
Lux Æterna

Lux Æterna

Emancipation
Kill isolation
Never alone for the feelings alike
Amplification
Lightning the nation
Never alive more
Than right here tonight

Full speed or nothing
Full speed or nothing

Lux Æterna
Lux Æterna

Light it


7. Crown Of Barbed Wire

So tight this crown of barbed wire
Its destiny I wear
It splits the skin to the soul
This jagged wreath I bear

This rusted empire I own
Bleed as I rust on this throne
Pierce
Me
With torment
And all the rust that I own

So tight
This crown of barbed wire
So tight
This crown of barbed wire
So tight, this crown

Fist tight, it stains conviction
Drips down to bloodshot eyes
It crushes down what is real
Deep crimson blots the skies

This rusted empire I own
Bleed as I rust on this throne
Pierce
Me
With torment
And all the rust that I own

So tight
This crown of barbed wire
So tight
This crown of barbed wire
So tight, this crown

This rusted empire I own
Bleed as I rust on this throne
Pierce
Me
With torment
And all the rust that I own

So tight
This crown of barbed wire
So tight
This crown of barbed wire
So tight this crown


8. Chasing Light

There's no light

Down and out as darkness falls
So much more than he can take
Shakes the cage in deep withdrawals
Come on, give the boy a break

Oh, he will break
He's no mistake

Chase that light, lean on me
Face that fight, lean on me
Catch your fall, lean on me
End it all, lean on me
Struggle on, 'cause without darkness
Without darkness, there's no light

Lost his way through wicked streets
But he is someone's little boy
All the love a young one needs
Thoughtless elders have destroyed

It is destroyed
He's just a boy

Chase that light, lean on me
Face that fight, lean on me
Catch your fall, lean on me
End it all, lean on me
Struggle on, 'cause without darkness
Without darkness, there's no light

One step down
Block it all from view
One step down
With apathy, look straight through
One step down
Turn so you won't see
One step down
He's just like you and me

Chase that light, lean on me
Face that fight, lean on me
Catch your fall, lean on me
End it all, lean on me
Struggle on, 'cause without darkness
Without darkness, there's no light

There's no light


9. If Darkness Had A Son

Temptation
Temptation
Temptation
Temptation

The beast still shouts for what it's yearning
He stokes the fire, desire burning
The never-ending quenchless craving
The unforgiven misbehaving

If darkness had a son, here I am
Temptation is his father
If darkness had a son, here I am
I bathe in holy water
Temptation, leave me be

Temptation
Temptation
Temptation
Temptation

So paint your eyes as black as sorrow
Hide yourself behind tomorrow
The nightmares search for infiltration
In domination, captivation

If darkness had a son, here I am
Temptation is his father
If darkness had a son, here I am
I bathe in holy water
Temptation, leave me be

Return again to where it's darkest
Dragging home this heathen harvest
And all the children subjugated
Manipulated, propagated

If darkness had a son, here I am
Temptation is his father
If darkness had a son, here I am
I bathe in holy water

If darkness had a son (Here I am)
If darkness had a son (Here I am)
If darkness had a son (Here I am)
I bathe in holy water
Temptation, leave me be


10. Too Far Gone?

I, I am desperation
Need it so bad today
I, I am isolation
Static and disarray
Need this, gotta have more
Crawling out my skin
Sickness, scarring returns
Burning me again

Too far gone
Am I too far gone
Am I too far gone to save?
Help me make it through the day
No

I, I am tribulation
Digging down to the bone
I, I am agitation
Never leaves me alone
Keep on, push it along
Don't want to feel this
Sink in, start to believe
That I don't exist

Too far gone
Am I too far gone
Am I too far gone to save?
Help me make it through the day
Oh

All away
I am desperation
All away
I am isolation
All away
I am agitation
All away

Too far gone
Never too far gone
I'm never too far gone to save
I can make it through the day

Make it through the day

Just for today


11. Room Of Mirrors

In a mirrored room
All alone I stand
Strip away the phantom fame
Exposing all sides to see
The good and bad in me

In a mirrored room
All alone I stand
Seeing past the flesh and bone
The shame and the fear I hide
Could I show you what's inside?

Would you
Criticize, scrutinize
Stigmatize my pain?
Would you
Summarize, patronize
Classify insane?

So I stand here
Before you
You might judge
You might just bury me

Or you might set me free

In a mirrored room
Talking to myself
And the voices pushing back
I'll let them inside my heart
But they'll tear it all apart

In a mirrored room
Just a simple man
Naked, broken, beat, and scarred
What do I really know?
That fear of letting go

Would you
Criticize, scrutinize
Analyze my pain?
Would you
Summarize, patronize
Classify insane?

So I stand here
Before you
You might judge
You might just bury me

Or you might set me
Or you might set me free

Would you
Criticize, scrutinize
Ostracize my pain?
Would you
Summarize, patronize
Classify insane?

So I stand here
Before you
You might judge
You might just bury me

Or you might set me
Oh, please won't you set me free


12. Inamorata

Welcome, won't you come inside
Meet the ghosts where I reside
Despite how they're abusing me
Lonely I will never be
Comfort in the hell I know
Resentment like a cancer grows
Longing for the day I'm free
Burn to get you out of me

Lying, supplying the need
Shedding and spreading the seed
Setting the trap with a thread
Spinning the web

Misery
She needs me
Oh, but I need her more

Misery
She loves me
Oh, but I love her more

Misery
She kills me
Oh, but I end this war

Misery
She fills me
Oh no, but she's not what I'm living for

Ricochets within my head
Conversations never said
Magnifying every thought
That familiar pain she brought
Seeps inside eventually
Misery loves company
Sullen, I created you
I suppose that I can end you too

She waits (She waits, she waits, she waits)

She waits (She waits, she waits, she waits)

Misery
She needs me
Oh, but I need her more

Misery
She loves me
Oh, but I love her more

Misery
She kills me
Ooh, but I end this war

Misery
She fills me
Oh no, but she's not what I'm living for
Oh no

Ooh, misery

She needs me
But I need her more
She loves me
But I love her more
She kills me (She kills me)
But I end this war
She fills me (She fills me)
But she's not what I'm living for

Oh no
Oh no
No, no, no, no, no, no
Not why I'm living

Misery
She needs me
Oh, but I need her more

Misery
She loves me
Oh, but I love her more

Misery
She kills me
Oh, but I end this war

Misery
She fills me
Oh no, but she's not what I'm living for

Misery
My misery

Misery
